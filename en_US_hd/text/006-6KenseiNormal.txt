(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN6_049_A2: Should he catch hold of your sword,\nI recommend swinging in the\n<color red<direction Ghirahim's hand opens>coloroff>.\n[1-]More info![2]Got it.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) KEN6_049_A3: My analysis confirms that <color red<Ghirahim>coloroff>'s \nfingers always point upward when\nhe holds <0x10012:0x00000001>your sword, Master.\n\nThe probability of escaping his grip\n<color red<by swinging your sword upward>coloroff>\nis approximately 100%.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN6_049_B0: I have detected a change in Ghirahim's\nfighting style from the beginning of \nthe battle. \n\nI theorize that this change happened\nbecause of the small amount of damage\nhe sustained.[1-]Tell me more![2]Understood.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN6_049_B1: Analysis indicates that the daggers\nGhirahim shoots will align on a single\nplane in one of three orientations:\nhorizontal, vertical, or diagonal.\nWith good timing, you might be able to\nrepel them with a single swing of your\nsword, but my judgment shows that this\nmaneuver will be difficult.[1-]Anything else?[2]Got it.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) KEN6_049_B2: I can now confirm that Ghirahim has\nthe ability to teleport.\n\n\nFurther study reveals that he may be\nvulnerable immediately after\nteleportation.

(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN6_049_B3: Ghirahim will repeatedly move around\nyou, <0x10012:0x00000002>Master. I recommend <color red<engaging>coloroff> \nhim with your sword as he makes his\nattack.\nIt is probable that the moment before\nGhirahim readies his attack, he will\nreveal the direction he will move\nas he attempts to flank you.\nIf you are unable to establish the\ncorrect timing to attack, I suggest\nusing your <color green<spin attack>coloroff>.

(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN6_050_A1: Analysis indicates that the daggers that\nappear around Ghirahim also act as a\ndefensive barrier.\n\nRemoving these daggers before\nattacking should be an effective means\nof breaking down his defenses.\n[1-]More info![2]Got it.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN6_050_A2: It appears that Ghirahim prefers to\nuse his right hand to attempt to grab\nyour sword, <0x10012:0x00000002>Master.\n\nShould he succeed, I recommend\n<color red<swinging your sword up and down\n>coloroff>to force him to release it.\n\nHowever, Ghirahim continues to utilize\nmore of his true power, and the\nprobability of it taking more than one\nswing to release your sword is 100%.\n[1-]Tell me more![2]Got it.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) KEN6_050_A3: To land an attack on Ghirahim, I\nadvise you to swing your sword from a\ndirection that cannot be blocked by\ndaggers or Ghirahim's right hand.\nGhirahim will move his right hand\nin time with your attacks.

(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN6_050_B0: I have detected a change in Ghirahim's\nfighting style since the beginning of\nthe battle.\n\nI have concluded that this change\nhappened because of the small amount\nof damage he sustained.\n[1-]Tell me more![2]Understood.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN6_050_B1: When Ghirahim shoots his daggers,\nI recommend repelling them by\nswinging your sword along the line\nthe knives are positioned in.\nLogically, if surrounded by daggers,\nusing <color red<a sword technique that attacks in \nall directions >coloroff>would be effective.\n[1-]Anything else?[2]I'm ready.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) KEN6_050_B2: There will be a significant opening for\ncounterattacks if you are able to avoid\nGhirahim's overhead attack when he\nteleports above your head.\nHe will teleport to places other than\nabove you, of course, but my analysis\nconfirms an interesting behavior\npattern.\nHe assumes different stances when he\nplans to teleport above you and when\nhe plans to go somewhere else.\n[1-]Anything else?[2]Got it.

(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN6_052_2: It is probable that the monster will be\nunable to move if you destroy all of\nits toes.\n\nI recommend using the air vents to\nmove ahead of the monster instead\nof chasing it from behind.\n[1-]Tell me more![2]Got it.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) KEN6_052_3: If you are able to get between the\nmonster's toes, my analysis indicates\nyou can effectively inflict great\ndamage with a <color green<spin attack>coloroff>.\nYou can also choose to decrease your\nrisk of physical harm by using <color yellow<bombs>coloroff> to\nattack from a distance.

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) KEN6_053_1: Analysis indicates that you should be\nable to use the same basic strategy as in\nthe previous encounter to seal the\nmonster in its prison once more.\nThe fingers and toes on its limbs can be\ndestroyed with a physical attack, but\nyou should wait to do so until these\ntargets become a very high priority.\n[1-]More info![2]Got it.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 1) KEN6_053_2: I calculate a 100% probability that the\nlarge apparatus Groose constructed\nwill be effective against this\nmonster.\nIt is likely that a direct hit from this\napparatus will stop the monster's\nmovement, creating a window of\nopportunity for you to attack.[1-]More info![2]Got it.

(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) KEN6_054_2: After toppling the monster, it is\npossible that the beast's enormous bulk\nmay prevent you from approaching\nthe <color red<sealing spike>coloroff>.\nIn this scenario, I recommend that you\ndescend a level and use an air vent to\ntravel to the head of the monster.\n[1-]More info![2]Got it.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN6_054_3: The monster has evolved to an\nimmensely powerful state.

(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN6_056_2: It is possible to store lightning in the\n<color red<Master Sword >coloroff>by raising your sword\nin the air as if you were readying a\n<color red<Skyward Strike>coloroff>.\nWhen lightning strikes in the distance\nand the sky lights up, quickly raise\nyour sword skyward to call down the\nlightning.\nHowever, be aware that while you are\nattempting to be struck by lightning,\nyou will be leaving yourself open to\nDemise's attacks.

It has developed the\nunsightly ability to spit rocks.\n\nThe creature prefers to sleep with tufts\nof grass on its head, so it has learned to\ntake on the appearance of grass in\norder to fool and defeat its prey.\nYou can use a shield to bounce the\nrocks this monster spits back at it.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN6_058: Target lock: <color blue<Octorok (Rock)>coloroff>\n\n\n\nThis monster descended from oceanic\nmollusks.

(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) KEN6_060: Target lock: <color blue<Blue Chuchu>coloroff>\n\n\n\nThis is a rare, aquatic Chuchu. Known\nfor attaching itself to unaware victims,\nits gelatinous body will clog your air\npipe, literally taking your breath away.\nIt is exceedingly dangerous to allow\none of the larger specimens to stick\nto you for any length of time.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN6_061: Target lock: <color blue<Yellow Chuchu>coloroff>\n\n\n\nYellow Chuchus are capable of\ngenerating electricity for short bursts\nof time. As with other Chuchus,\nI suggest you remain on guard.\nIf you make contact with this type of\nChuchu when it is charged, it will give\nyou a shock. Then it will attempt to\nfeed on you. This is not pleasant.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN6_062: Target lock: <color blue<Green Chuchu>coloroff>\n\n\n\nThese creatures prefer exceptionally\ndamp environments.

(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) KEN6_065_0: Its body is completely covered in rock,\nbut you can see its weak point, the <color red<eye>coloroff>,\nthrough the cracks in this outer shell.\n\nIf you are able to remove parts of this\ncreature's rocky shell, you will vastly\nincrease your probability of success.[1-]More info![2]Understood.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN6_065_1: There is a 0% probability that your\nsword will be effective against the\nrock that covers this target's body.\n\nI strongly recommend using items with\npowerful destructive properties.\n[1-]More info![2]Got it.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN6_065_2: There is a 100% probability that <color yellow<bombs>coloroff>\nthat come into contact with Scaldera's\nbody will immediately explode, due to\nthe creature's high body temperature.\nAnalysis indicates that explosions on\nScaldera's outer surface will not yield\ndesired results, however.

(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) KEN6_065_3: Results from my analysis confirm that\nin order to remove the rocks covering\nScaldera, you will need to inflict\npowerful internal damage.\nWhen Scaldera is inhaling a large\namount of air, I suggest<color red< throwing a\nbomb >coloroff><color red<into its mouth>coloroff>.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN6_066: Target lock: <color blue<Magmanos>coloroff>\n\n\n\nThis hand-shaped monster dwells\nin fiery lava. Its body is made up\nentirely of flowing magma.

(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) KEN6_068: Target lock: <color blue<Ampilus\n>coloroff>\n\n\nThese monsters have inhabited the\ndesert for eons. Their defining\ncharacteristic is an ability to internally\ngenerate electrical energy.\nIt is also said they live to a very old\nage. Their shells are able to disperse\nweight surprisingly well, allowing them\nto safely traverse desert sinksand.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN6_069: Target lock: <color blue<Armos>coloroff>\n\n\n\nThis security and defense mechanism\nwas developed long ago. It will attack\nanything that enters its security\nperimeter.\nAccording to my records, its weak\npoint is its mouth, but it requires some\nspecific measure to make it open\nits mouth.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN6_070: Target lock: <color blue<Beamos>coloroff>\n\n\n\nThis is an ancient security mechanism.\nIts weak point is its eye. The eye is also\na weapon that fires a focused energy\nbeam.\nI calculate a 100% failure rate at any\nattempt to strike the eye with your \nsword while it is still on top of the\npedestal.\nI recommend using a weapon that\ncan strike at high targets. Conversely,\nyou could lower its head to a height\nyour sword can reach.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) KEN6_071: Target lock: <color blue<Sentrobe>coloroff>\n\n\n\nThis security drone was built in\nancient times.

Stopping such an\nassault could prove difficult.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) KEN6_074: Target lock: <color blue<Magma Spume>coloroff>\n\n\n\nThis odd creature is quite at home in\nmagma. It stores and processes gas\nproduced by the magma into a flaming\nprojectile that it then spits out.\nCowardly by nature, it sits with its eyes\njust out of the lava in order to detect\nany danger and flee if necessary.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN6_075: Target lock: <color blue<Cursed Spume>coloroff>\n\n\n\nThis mysterious monster's natural\nhabitat includes poisonous swamps and\nother dangerous environments.

(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN6_077_0: As you can likely gather from its other\ntitle, this “Abyssal Leviathan\" is said to\nhave been a tyrant of the ancient seas.\n\nIts <color yellow<<color red<enormous tentacles<color yellow< >coloroff>can be repelled,\nbut they will regenerate after a\nshort time.\n[1-]More info![2]Understood.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN6_077_A1: My analysis shows that by repelling\na number of its aggressive tentacles,\nthe beast will reveal itself.\n\nThere is a 99% probability that the\ntentacles that attacked you on the ship,\nMaster, can be attributed to Tentalus.\n\nI theorize that using a <color red<sacred power>coloroff> \nwill be the most effective means\nof repelling the tentacles.\n[1-]More info![2]Got it.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) KEN6_077_A2: Results from my analysis confirm that\nits tentacles can be severed with a\nwell-aimed <color red<Skyward Strike>coloroff>.\n\nI theorize that the creature's <color red<eye>coloroff> is its \nweak point, but the probability that you\ncan actually hit the eye with a Skyward\nStrike is approximately 0%.\nInstead, I recommend utilizing\nlong-range weapons.\n[1-]More info![2]Got it.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN6_077_A3: To accurately strike at the creature's\n<color yellow<eye>coloroff>—its weak spot—a <color yellow<bow>coloroff> will be most\neffective.\n\nYou can press (ControlStick2) to move with your\n<color red<<color yellow<bow<color red< >coloroff>drawn. I recommend shooting\n<color red<arrows >coloroff>immediately after dodging\nattacks launched by Tentalus.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN6_077_B1: In order to attack Tentalus's weak\nspot, its <color red<eye>coloroff>, you must first deal with\nthe tentacles attempting to latch on\nto you.\nMy analysis shows you can easily\nslice the tip of the tentacles with\nyour sword.\n[1-]More info![2]Got it.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) KEN6_077_B2: Because this monster's tentacles attack\nincessantly and in large number, it is\ntoo dangerous to respond to them one\nat a time.\nMy analysis indicates it is possible to\nrepel the tentacles more efficiently by\nconcentrating an all-out assault on\nthem with your sword.\n[1-]More info![2]Got it.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN6_077_B3: When the tentacles are repelled,\nthey may drop <color red<hearts>coloroff> and <color red<arrows>coloroff>.\n\n\nShould you find yourself in danger\nbecause of low hearts or arrows,\nconcentrate on attacking the tentacles\nrather than fleeing from battle.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN6_078: Target lock: <color blue<Deku Baba>coloroff>\n\n\n\nThis violent plant is widespread in\nwooded areas.
