OBJ_SHIELD_LOST_SV: \x0E\x01\x0F\x00Your <item7E> has\nrefilled your shield gauge!\x0F\x01\x0F

OBJ_GET_TRUSTEE_02: Your pouch is full, but so is your space at\nthe <r<Item Check>>. The item has been put\nback in the treasure chest.
OBJ_GOSSIP_00: Boing-oing!
OBJ_GOSSIP_01: You can get a valuable treasure if\nyou succeed in cutting the bamboo\nstalk <r<over 28 times >>at <b<Clean Cut>>.\n\nPeater, who was formerly the teen\nheartthrob of Skyloft, claims to hold\nthe record with 43 slices. Or so\nhe says...
OBJ_GOSSIP_02: You may get rare and difficult-to-\ncatch bugs if you finish the Bug\nWrangler challenge in <b<Bug Heaven>>\n<r<within two minutes>>.
OBJ_GOSSIP_03: <r<Butterflies>> tend to gather around \n<b<Gossip Stones>> like myself.\n\n\nIf you find a spot swarming with\nbutterflies, play a<r< tune of great beauty>>\nand a Gossip Stone might just pop\nout of the ground with a boing-oing!
OBJ_GOSSIP_04: I've heard some of the <b<Goddess Cubes\n>>unlock all sorts of treasure when they\nfly up into the sky. Some even hold\na <r<Piece of Heart>>.

OBJ_GOSSIP_07_01: Do you want to hear that again?\n[1]Yes.[2-]No.
OBJ_GOSSIP_07_02: A <r<dragon>> is said to live at the <r<peak >>of\nthis volcano. You're nowhere near the\npeak, though!
OBJ_GOSSIP_07_03: Rumor has it you're some kind of\ngenius that remembers things perfectly\nthe first time you hear them...
OBJ_GOSSIP_08: I hear the <r<dragon>> that lives at the\ntop of the volcano is awfully chatty.\n\n\nSo chatty, they say, that he's even\nwilling to talk about matters outside\nhis own realm!
OBJ_GOSSIP_08_01: The word going around is that a <r<dragon>>\nwrapped in flames lives atop this\nvolcano.\n\nThe thing is, it isn't so easy to visit.\nHe's made his lair <r<somewhere so hot\n>>that normal folks can't bother him.
OBJ_GOSSIP_09: Word is you can earn a <r<Piece of Heart>>\nif you set a great time on the <b<Rickety\nCoaster>>.
OBJ_GOSSIP_10: They say somewhere in this vast desert,\nthere's a <r<dragon>> who loves putting the\nabilities of those who visit him to some\nkind of test.\nIf you can master the challenges he\nthrows at you, you'll be rewarded with\na <r<shield stronger than any other>>.
OBJ_GOSSIP_11: It's been said that the best way to snag\na rare insect is to approach it slowly\nand use a <y<Big Bug Net>>.

OBJ_GOSSIP_14: They say drawing a symbol of love upon\ncertain walls will heal your wounds.
OBJ_GOSSIP_15: Oddly enough, it seems that drawing\na circle on certain strange walls will\nproduce something round.

OBJ_GOSSIP_17: Rumor has it there's a <y<Piece of Heart\n>>hidden somewhere nearby.
OBJ_GOSSIP_18: The thing is, to get to it you need to be\nable to burrow like a <b<Mogma>>.
OBJ_GOSSIP_19: Oh, but since you've already picked it\nup, this obviously doesn't come as a\nbig surprise to you. Hmph.
