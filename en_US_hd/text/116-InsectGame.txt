(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) INS_01_02: <0x10009:0x00120513>Well, I guess that means you never\nwere a real bug lover.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) INS_01_03: <0x10009:0x00000001>You ready to start catching some\nbugs? Maybe you'll get bitten by the\nbug-catching fever, just like me.\nOr maybe you'll just get bitten...\nAnyway, it's <color red<20 Rupees >coloroff>for the Bug\nBeginner level or <color red<50 >coloroff>for the Bug\nWrangler level.

(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) INS_01_04: <0x10009:0x00120315>Looks like you don't have enough\nmoney. So what if we went to the\nKnight Academy together? I'm not\ncutting you any deals.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) INS_01_05: <0x10009:0x00120813>Think you can go bug catching with\nso few <color red<hearts>coloroff>? You're not taking this\nseriously. It's not looking good for you.\n\n<0x10009:0x00000100>Come back once you get some\nmore hearts.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) INS_01_06: <0x10009:0x00030100>I'm going to be timing you while you're\nin the course.

(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) INS_01_10: <0x10009:0x00120500>So you really are quitting... I guess you\ndon't appreciate bugs like I do.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) INS_01_11: I know, right? Time flies when you're\ncatching bugs!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) INS_01_12: <0x10009:0x00120500>Uhh...don't you think you're taking\ntoo long?\n\n\n<0x10009:0x00000100>I know you're not done yet, but I'm\ncalling it. Time's up!

Just keep on\npracticing.\n\n<0x10009:0x00030100>Oh, at night, I buy bugs back in my\nroom in Skyloft. You should come by\nand sell me any beauties you find.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) INS_02_02: <0x10009:0x00120104>Time's up! That was pretty decent,\nI have to admit.\n\n\n<0x10009:0x00000100>Your times will get even better if you\nremember where the bugs live. Next\ntime, shoot for <color red<under three minutes>coloroff>.

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) INS_02_07a: <0x10009:0x00030100>Next time, try for <color red<under three minutes>coloroff>.\nOh, and I guess I should throw you\na little money. Here's <color red<30 Rupees>coloroff>.
