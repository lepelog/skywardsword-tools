TOWN6_00: Hey there, friend! What luck you have!\nYou've just stumbled upon me, the\ninfamous <b<Moonlight Merchant>>!\n\nDon't ask how I get my wares, 'cause\nI'm not telling!\n\n\nIf there's a rare bauble or two you're\ndying to get your hands on, I might\nknow a stone who knows a stone who\ncan get them for you...for a price!
TOWN6_01: But...but! Before you go whipping out\nyour Rupees, you should know my\nwares carry a hefty price tag.\n\nPeople who come to me usually don't\nlike collecting treasure on their own,\nor simply can't manage to collect what\nthey need. You sure this is for you?\n[1]Sure![2-]No way.
TOWN6_02: Excellent! So, tell me, what kind of\ntreasure are you in the market for?\n[1]<itemAE>[2]<itemAF>[3]<itemB0>[4-]Other.
TOWN6_03: Something else, huh? Well do any of\nthese pique your interest?\n[1]<itemA8>[2]<itemAD>[3]<itemAB>[4-]Other.
TOWN6_12: Sorry, friend, that's all I've got to sell\nright now. If none of those did the trick\nfor you, you'll just have to find what\nyou're after on your own!
TOWN6_03_01: OK, one <itemAE> it is!\nFor <r<200 Rupees>>, it's all yours!\n[1]Sounds good![2-]Too much.
TOWN6_03_02: OK, one <itemAF> it is! This baby's\nall yours for just <r<200 Rupees>>.\n[1]Sounds good![2-]Too much.
TOWN6_03_03: OK, one <itemB0> coming right\nup! That'll be just <r<200 Rupees>>, friend.\n[1]Sounds good![2-]Too much.
TOWN6_03_04: OK, one <itemA8> it is! It's a steal at\njust <r<100 Rupees>>.\n[1]Sounds good![2-]Too much.
TOWN6_03_05: OK, one <itemAD> it is!\nFor <r<100 Rupees>> it's all yours!\n[1]Sounds good![2-]Too much.
TOWN6_03_06: OK, one <itemAB> it is!\nFor <r<100 Rupees>> it's all yours!\n[1]Sounds good![2-]Too much.
TOWN6_04: Fine then. Folks who walk the straight\nand narrow are better off not getting\nmixed up with a shady character like\nmyself anyhow. Know what I'm saying?
TOWN6_05: Puh-leeeze, I've heard that one before.\nYou say it costs too much. I say you\nprobably didn't want it that much in\nthe first place or you'd cough it up!
TOWN6_06: And we have a deal! Here's your\nnot-at-all-shady treasure!
TOWN6_07: Hmm. Looking a little short on funds\nthere, friend. Oh well. When you\nscrape together the Rupees, you know\nI'll be here.
TOWN6_08: Hopefully your purchase lives up to\nyour expectations, fella! If you get the\nitch to buy some more treasure, you\nknow the stone to talk to.
TOWN6_09: Hey there, friend! What luck you have!\nYou've just stumbled upon one of th\x2014<pause14>\nOh. You again. You looking to buy\nsome treasure or what?\n[1]Yep![2-]Nah...
TOWN6_10: So you're looking to buy then, eh?\n[1]Please![2-]Nah...
TOWN6_11: You're a weird one, climbing all the\nway up here.\n\n\nHey, if you tried to <g<dive>> off the ledge\nhere, I bet you could land in the\nnest on top of the tower down there.\nBut what do I know? I'm a stone.
