(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) TOWN4_01: Only one thing to do when you're tired:\nget some sleep. <pause 25><color green<You can sleep anywhere\nthere's a bed>coloroff>, you know?\n\nSkyloft is a different place after the\nsun goes down. It's no lie.\n\n\n<color green<Find a bed and take a nap>coloroff> to sleep until\nnightfall. There's all kinds of curious\nthings to enjoy at night...
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) TOWN4_20: Have you explored Skyloft at night?\nIt's a different place under the cover\nof darkness.\n\nFor example, if you go to the Gear \nShop owner's house at night, he'll buy \nyour treasures.\n\nNow it's true there are dangers to be\nfound at night, but a student at the\nKnight Academy should have no\ntrouble with that.\nAll you have to do is <color green<nap in a bed >coloroff>until\nnightfall.<pause 25> That's it!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN4_01_01: I haven't seen the <color blue<fortune-teller >coloroff>much\nthese days...\n\n\nYou know his crystal ball got broken,\nright? I just hope he's not sitting at\nhome kicking himself for not\nforeseeing this.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) TOWN4_01_02: His place is over on the <color red<eastern\nedge of town>coloroff>...\n\n\nIt's a bit too quiet around here without\nhim. Why don't you go check on him?\nMake sure he's doing all right.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) TOWN4_01_03: Would you mind running over and\nchecking in on him?\n\n\nHis house is on the<color red< eastern edge >coloroff>of\nSkyloft.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN4_01_04: With the fortune-teller back on the\njob, this place feels alive again. \nIt's just not the same without him.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) TOWN4_01_05: So the fortune-teller's at home with\na case of the blues, eh?\n\n\nI wonder if he'd come back if we found\nhim a new crystal ball...
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) TOWN4_01_06: What?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN4_02: So you're on your way to becoming\na knight now, right? Congratulations!\n\n\nBut I'm sure there's still plenty you\ndon't know. Don't forget to press <icon 19>\nif you need a pointer or two.<0x10011:0x0bcd>

(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) TOWN4_02_02: I've been hearing a weird rumor.\nApparently, after <color red<nightfall>coloroff>, people\nhave been hearing a woman sobbing\nin the<color red< dormitory>coloroff>.\nI tell you, it gives even a big guy like\nme the creeps.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN4_02_03: What? <pause 20>Calling out for toilet paper\nwhile you're stuck in the restroom?\n\n\nYikes, that's rough. I should know—\nI've been there before.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) TOWN4_02_04: Huh? A hand? Reaching out of the\nstall?\n\n\nThat...<pause 20>that's one way of going about\nit, I guess.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) TOWN4_03: <0x10009:0x00000001>Hey, <heroname>! Today's the big\nday, isn't it? You know, the Wing\nCeremony thing!\n\nWin this thing, and you'll get bumped\nup to the senior class.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN4_03_01: Here in Skyloft, it's being able to ride a\nLoftwing that separates the kids from\nthe adults.\n\n<0x10009:0x000a0404>And if your goal is to become a knight,\nwell, good technique is even more\nimportant. All of us learned to fly the\nhard way: lots of practice.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) TOWN4_04: <0x10009:0x00000002>Ever heard of banging your knuckles\nagainst the door? It's called knocking.\nBarging into someone's house is what\nmost people call...rude.\nAnyway, you're lucky I'm home.\nI'm usually over at the bazaar working\nat my stall, but we're closed for the \nWing Ceremony.\n<0x10009:0x00000015>Most days at work all I can think about\nis how bored I am, but now that I'm\nnot at work, I'm...even more bored!\nMy life is pretty sad...

(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) TOWN4_08_02: It IS tough! That greasy lug nut is\nfraying my wires!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN4_08_03: He's up at unspeakable hours trying to\nrepair that rusty pile of an old robot he\ninherited!\n\nWhat he intends to do with that\nscrap-heap reject is beyond me!
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) TOWN4_08_04: I thought he would settle down a bit\nand maybe even wash his hands now\nthat he's got that robot up and running,\nbut he's still tinkering away!\nI'm telling you, that boy will never get\nthe grease out from beneath his\nfingernails. Ah...

(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) TOWN4_12_01: <0x10009:0x00000004>I wonder where that little mischief\nmaker Kukiel's gone off to now.\n\n\nHer mom thinks she was kidnapped,\nbut I'm not so sure.\n\n\n<0x10009:0x000e0d00>I mean, there's nobody here in Skyloft\nwho would do such a thing, right?\n\n\n<0x10009:0x00000d0f>I bet she'll show up sooner or later.\n\n\n\nAnyway, keep your eyes peeled, and let\nus know right away if you see her.

It's supposedly\nhere to help people find Skyloft and\nprevent them from crashing into us.\n<0x10009:0x000f0d00>But I've never seen any light coming\nout of it. I wonder who built it.\nAnd why...\n\n<0x10009:0x00100d00>You should climb all the way to the top,\nanyway. There's one amazing view of\nthe goddess from up there.

(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) TOWN4_16_07: Let me share a bit of wisdom with you.\n\n\n\n<0x10009:0x00010700>The sky is filled with floating islands\nof all shapes and sizes.

(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) TOWN4_17: You looking to get your grub on?\nThe food here is sooooo good!\n\n\nYou gotta be patient, though. It seems\nlike you wait forever for anything\naround here.
