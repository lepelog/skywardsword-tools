(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Demo04_01:38: I'm glad to see my <color red<Loftwing >coloroff>got you out\nof bed.\n\n\n<pause 30><0x10006:0xffcd>I was pretty sure you'd sleep in and\nforget to meet me this morning.
(unk1: 30, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:02: But look at this instrument! And look\nat this outfit! They're mine to use today\nin the <color red<ceremony>coloroff>, since I'll be playing\nthe role of the goddess.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 30) Demo04_01:03: Aren't they beautiful? Especially this \ninstrument! They tell me it's just like \nthe one the goddess was said to have in\nthe legends.\nIt sounds gorgeous too. I asked <color blue<Father\n>coloroff>about it, and he says it's called a <color blue<harp>coloroff>.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Demo04_01:39: And look at these clothes!

(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) Demo04_01:05: Hah, I think so too! But it's nice to\nknow you agree. Thanks,\n<heroname>.

(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:07: And what exactly is THAT supposed to\nmean, you goof? If you think I look\nsilly, just come out and say it.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:08: Ah, there you are, <color blue<Zelda>coloroff>. Are you all\nprepared for today's ceremony?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo04_01:09: Oh, hello, <color blue<Father>coloroff>.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:10: Ah, <heroname>, you're here too. \nOutstanding.\n\n\nIt's encouraging to see you up so early,\ngiven your capacity for sleep. No doubt\ntoday's ceremony had you too excited\nto close your eyes for once!
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:11: If you win today's ceremonial race,\nyou'll get to participate in the \npostrace ritual with Zelda, so give it\nyour best out there.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo04_01:12: Yes. About that<0x10006:0xfecd>...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:40: Father, I don't know if he can do it!\n\n\n\nRecently <heroname> hasn't\nbeen practicing much at all\nfor the ceremony!
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:41: And even when he's out riding his\nLoftwing, he's just lazily gliding\naround. Probably daydreaming!\n\nI don't know what he's thinking. \nHe's going to have to be in perfect \ncontrol of his bird to win today.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo04_01:13: No need to worry yourself, Zelda.\n\n\n\nThough you may have a point. \nToday's <color red<Wing Ceremony >coloroff>tests the skill\nof the rider as well as his bond to his\nbird. Victory will not come easily.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:14: And, as you pointed out, I haven't seen\nhim practicing as hard as some of the\nother students.\n\nBut you've known him since you were\nboth very little. You should know \nbetter than to fret about him!\n\nYou see, <heroname> and his\nLoftwing share a special connection. \nI've never seen anything quite like it.
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:15: As you know, each of us in Skyloft is\nbut one half of a pair.\n\n\nWe are only made whole by our\nLoftwings, the <color red<guardian birds >coloroff>that \nthe goddess bestows upon each of us\nas a symbol of her divine protection.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo04_01:16: When we are young, every one of us \nmeets our Loftwing under the great\nStatue of the Goddess. It's quite a big\nmoment, as I'm sure you recall.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:17: Ahh, but that first meeting between\n<heroname> and his Loftwing was\nextraordinary.\n\nThe bird that came to him was a\n<color red<Crimson Loftwing>coloroff>. It is a breed so rare\nwe were sure for some time that it had\nvanished from the line.
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:18: Yes, and the boy and his bird seemed\nto share a profound connection from\nthe moment they met.\n\nDo you recall when <heroname> \nand that Loftwing of his first met?\nWhat a sight!\n\nThe little boy just hopped up on that\nbird and gracefully flew away, without\neven a moment of instruction!\nThey were meant for each other.\nAnd judging by how jealous you were\nthat day, I'd say the friendship he\nshared with his bird didn't go\nunnoticed by you, my dear.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo04_01:43: Ah, but who can blame you? I'm sure\nyou weren't the only one envious of\nthe powerful bond shared by\n<heroname> and his bird.\nAnyone who is a part of something\nspecial is bound to catch some nasty\nlooks sooner or later, hoo hoo.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:19: This contest is nothing to laugh at,\nFather! This ceremony is part of the\nfinal test for those training to become \nknights of Skyloft!
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:20: If <heroname> doesn't fly fast\nenough during the race... 
(unk1: 01, unk2: 8) Demo04_01:21: What if <heroname> messes up\nhis big chance<0x10006:0xfecd>...<0x10006:0x00cd><pause 15> What if he's not\nallowed to become a knight?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 2) Demo04_01:22: Calm down, my dear. It will be fine.\n\n\n\nHonestly, it's almost as though you\nbecome a completely different person\nwhen you worry about\n<heroname>.
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:23: Listen, <heroname>, you'd better\nfly your heart out today. At the very\nleast, you need to squeeze in a little\npractice time before the race!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 8) Demo04_01:24: Come on! You'll thank me later!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:25: Here we are. Go on now. Jump off \nthe edge and call your Loftwing. \nIt's almost time for the ceremony,\nso try to practice seriously for once!\nHmm? <pause 15>Oh yeah?<pause 15> You can't “sense\"\nyour bird out there?\n\n\nOh, I get it. You're trying to weasel out\nof having to practice! Nice try, but\nyou're not fooling me.
(unk1: 08, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:26: Off you go!<0x10005:0x001e0000>
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo04_01:27: OK, <heroname>, go ahead!\nJust <color green<press >coloroff>(v) and call your Loftwing!<0x10005:0x003c0000>
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:28: Hmm...<pause 30> His bird sure is taking a long\ntime to get here...<0x10005:0x003c0000>
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:29: Something's wrong!<0x10005:0x001e0000>
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo04_01:30: Hang in there, <heroname>!\nI've got you!<0x10005:0x001e0000>
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:31: Are you two all right?<0x10005:0x003c0000>
(unk1: 08, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:32: I'm sorry, friend. I didn't mean to push\nyou so hard. You didn't sprain your\nwing, did you?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 8) Demo04_01:33: This is very odd, <heroname>.\nWhat could have possibly happened to\nyour Loftwing?\n\nFor a bird to ignore the call of his\nmaster... It's unheard of!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:34: And you still can't sense your bird\nnearby, eh, <heroname>?\n\n\nThis is quite a problem, especially\nconsidering the <color red<Wing Ceremony >coloroff>is\nabout to start...
(unk1: 08, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:35: <0x10008:0x00cd><0x30001:0x><heroname>, when you said you\ncouldn't sense your Loftwing, well...\nI should have believed you.<0x10006:0xfecd>\n...<0x10006:0x00cd>I'm sorry.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 8) Demo04_01:36: I need to tend to my own Loftwing, so\nI'll catch up with you later.\n\n\nYou'd better go on ahead and see if you\ncan find where your bird has gone!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:37: My, how did it get to be so late?\nIf I recall correctly, this year \n<color blue<Instructor Horwell>coloroff> is presiding over \nthe <color red<ceremony>coloroff>. \n<0x30001:0x><heroname>, you should go\nexplain the situation to him and see if\nhe's willing to delay the race a little\nso that you can find your bird.
(unk1: 08, unk2: 1) Demo04_01:42: But, Father, you're the <color red<headmaster >coloroff>of\nthe academy! If <heroname> asks\n<color blue<Instructor Horwell>coloroff>, he'll probably\njust come talk to you about it.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 8) Demo04_01:44: Ah, quite true. As usual, you make an\nexcellent point, my dear.\n\n\nVery well, I'll explain the situation\nto him myself. <0x30001:0x><heroname>, run\nalong and tell Instructor Horwell\nto come see me in my quarters.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo05_01:00: ...You know, <color blue<Groose>coloroff>, that sure was a\npain, what with all the scratching and\npecking.
(unk1: 08, unk2: 1) Demo05_01:01: Course it was. You thought a big\n<color red<Crimson Loftwing>coloroff> like that was\ngonna go down without a fight?
(unk1: 02, unk2: 3) Demo05_01:02: But we got him, and I don't care how\ntough those birds are supposed to be.\nHe's not getting out of that pen\nanytime soon, boys.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 2) Demo05_01:03: <0x10008:0x01cd>Whoa!\n<0x10008:0x00cd><0x30001:0x><heroname>! So, uh...yeah.\nJust how long you been standing there?
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo05_01:04: What's your problem, anyway?\nOh, wait...I got it. You're here to talk\nabout today's <color red<race>coloroff>. I can see it in those\ndopey eyes of yours.\nThey're pleading, “<0x10006:0xffcd>Oh, Groose, can you\nplease find it in your heart to let me\nwin today? Please!\"<0x10006:0x00cd>\n\nYou're just desperate to win so you can\nget some <color red<alone time >coloroff>with Zelda up on\nthe <color red<Statue of the Goddess >coloroff>at the end of\nthe ceremony.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo05_01:05: Well, sorry, pal. Groose doesn't do\ncharity for wimps. My advice? Work\nhard and wish with all your heart.\nYou might even come in second.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo05_01:06: <0x10006:0xffcd>...Say, come to think of it, how come I\ndon't see your bird?<pause 15><0x10006:0x00cd> Where is that\nscruffy pile of red feathers?<pause 20>
(unk1: 08, unk2: 1) Demo05_01:07: I can't imagine what could've happened\nto him. Do you think his tiny brain got\nconfused by all the clouds and got lost?<pause 30>\n[1-]Bring it on.[2-]Give him back![3-]Nice hair.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 3) Demo05_01:08: Pfft. Sure. Only thing is, I don't know\nhow you're going to do that with no\nbird! You gonna grow wings?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo05_01:09: Huh? I've got no idea what you're\ntalking about.
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo05_01:10: You lay off my do right now, or I'll\nflatten you. Everyone knows I've\ngot the slickest pompadour in town.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo05_01:11: You know, we're all getting tired of\nhow you never let anyone forget you\nand Zelda <color red<go way back>coloroff>.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo05_01:12: You've been friends since you were\nkids? Big deal. It doesn't change the\nfact that you float through life with\nyour head in the clouds.
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo05_01:13: Would you wake up, straighten up,\nand grow a backbone already?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo05_01:14: Dopes like you are dragging our\nhonored academy through the mud.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo05_01:15: <0x10006:0xffcd>And just who might you be talking\nabout, Groose?
(unk1: 08, unk2: 1) Demo05_01:16: Oh...<pause 30>Zelda. Hey. Nah, it's...uh...\n
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo05_01:17: Don't even try it, Groose! You're\npicking on <heroname> again,\naren't you?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo05_01:18: He's a student at the academy,\nlike all of us.
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo05_01:19: Why do you insist on bullying him\naround so much?
(unk1: 02, unk2: 8) Demo05_01:20: <0x10006:0xffcd>Yeah... I suppose...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 2) Demo05_01:21: You suppose? Suppose what?
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo05_01:22: <0x10006:0xfecd>I...suppose...you... Er...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 8) Demo05_01:23: Pfft! Forget it. I wasn't supposing\nanything, OK?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo05_01:24: OK, we're outta here, boys.\nLater, <heroname>! Hope you\nfind your bird, or else you're gonna\nhave to sit out today's race!
(unk1: 08, unk2: 1) Demo05_01:25: That could be a major setback toward\nknighthood, so find that bird or get\nreal used to the taste of failure! \nIt's your special flavor.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo05_01:26: I hate to say it, but I'm beginning to \nsuspect that those blockheads had \nsomething to do with your Loftwing's\ndisappearance.\n<0x30001:0x><heroname>, those guys aren't\ngoing to help us find your bird,\nso we'd better start searching.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo05_01:27: I'll fly around Skyloft and see if I can\nspot any trace of your bird.
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo05_01:28: Father said he'd talk to Instructor\nHorwell about delaying the start of the\nWing Ceremony, so don't worry. \nWe'll find your bird in time.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 8) Demo08_01:00: We should hurry, <heroname>.\nNow that your Loftwing is free, you\nshould fly to the <color red<ceremony>coloroff><0x10006:0xffcd>...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo08_01:01: But before you go, I have to ask you\nsomething. I<0x10006:0xfecd>...<pause 20><0x10006:0x00cd>I heard this voice a few\nmoments ago. Did you hear it too?
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo08_01:02: It's been happening a lot lately. It's the\nstrangest feeling... Almost like\nsomeone is calling out to me.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 8) Demo08_01:03: <0x30001:0x>Have you ever wondered what's\nbeneath the clouds?\n\n\nSome say that it's an empty, barren\nplace, or even that there's nothing at\nall down below, but I just have this\nfeeling that they're wrong.\nSome of Father's old texts talk about a\nplace called the <color red<surface>coloroff>. The old\ntales describe a whole world under\nthere, far more vast than Skyloft!\nThe thing is, no one's ever been down\nthere to see it, and our Loftwings won't\nfly through the cloud barrier.\n\n<0x10006:0xfecd>...<0x10006:0x00cd>But I can't help imagining the wild\nthings that might be waiting below.<pause 30>\nSomeday, I want to see for myself.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo08_01:04: Oh, sorry, <heroname>. We don't\nhave time to talk! Let's get going.\n<pause 20>Look, your bird's waiting for you!\n\nJust leap off the edge and <color green<press >coloroff>(v).\nDon't worry about falling. Your bird \nwill catch you for sure this time!<0x10011:0x09cd>

(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo11_01:02: Great flying, <heroname>!\nCongratulations!
(unk1: 11, unk2: 1) Demo11_01:03: Now we'd better get on with the\nceremony!<0x10005:0x00b40000>
(unk1: 01, unk2: 11) Demo11_01:04: <0x30001:0x><heroname>, hand me that Bird\nStatuette you grabbed in the race.<pause 15>\nI must offer it to the goddess.

(unk1: 11, unk2: 1) Demo11_01:15: And just what are you thinking?\nDon't be silly. This is your big moment,\n<heroname>.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 11) Demo11_01:16: Heehee, I'm glad you're so well \ninformed on the subject.

(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo12_02:03: It really was wonderful.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo12_02:04: You know... <heroname>...
(unk1: 11, unk2: 1) Demo12_02:05: There's something I've been meaning to\ntalk to you about...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo12_02:06: What is that?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo12_02:07: What's going on?
(unk1: 11, unk2: 1) Demo12_02:08: Ahhh! <0x30001:0x><heroname>!<0x10005:0x002d0000>
(unk1: 01, unk2: 11) Demo13_01:01: <0x10012:0x0000000d><0x30001:0x><heroname>...?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo13_01:02: I am waiting for you.\n\n\n\nThe time has come for you to awaken.\n\n\n\nYou are vital to a mission of great\nimportance.
(unk1: 11, unk2: 1) Demo13_01:03: <0x10012:0x0000000d><0x30001:0x><heroname>...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 11) Demo14_01:01: ...Ah, you're awake.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo14_01:02: When your Loftwing carried you back,\nyou were limp and unconscious.\nI feared the worst.\n\nFortunately, you don't appear to have\nany serious injuries. For that much\nwe can be grateful.
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo14_01:03: But, <heroname>...\nWhere's Zelda? She was with you,\nwas she not?\n\n<pause 15><0x10006:0xffcd>...<pause 15>What's happened to my daughter?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo14_01:04: A black tornado, you say? Hmm.\nThat was no ordinary storm.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo14_01:05: You must not push yourself.\nYou're still recovering.\n\n\nTell me, when you saw Zelda today,<pause 20>\ndid anything about her seem...off?
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo14_01:06: I see. She was talking about the\n<color red<surface >coloroff>then?\n\n\nAnd you've been having dreams about\na “great mission\"? How interesting...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo14_01:07: I'm sorry. I was lost in thought there\nfor a moment. It's all very strange, but\nI doubt there's much of a connection\nbetween these things.\nI'm concerned for Zelda, but so long\nas she's with her Loftwing, I'm sure\nshe'll be fine.\n\nEither way, daybreak has yet to arrive.\nIt would be very difficult to spot one\ngirl and her bird in the dark of night.\nIt would also be very dangerous.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo14_01:08: 
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo14_01:09: Rest now, <heroname>.\nZelda's going to be fine. She's out\nthere alive. I know it.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo15_01:01: The one chosen by my creator.\nI have been waiting for you.\nYou will play a role in a great destiny.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo15_01:02: According to your social customs,\nI should provide you with my personal\ndesignation. <color blue<Fi>coloroff> is the name I was given.\n\nI was created for a single purpose,\nlong before the recorded memory of \nyour people.\n\nI must aid you in fulfilling the great\ndestiny that is your burden to carry.
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo15_01:03: Come, <heroname>.\nYou must take up this sword. As the\none chosen by my creator, it is your\ndestiny.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo15_01:04: The strange dreams troubling your\nsleep.<pause 15> My sudden appearance.<pause 15>\nUncertainty surrounding the fate of\none you hold dear.<pause 15>\nUnder the circumstances, it is only\nlogical that you would exhibit some \napprehension.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo15_01:05: To minimize your uncertainty, allow\nme to share some information.\n\n\nMy projections indicate that this\ninformation has a high probability of\naltering your current emotional state.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) Demo15_01:06: The one you seek, honorable <color blue<Zelda>coloroff>,\nis still alive.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Demo15_01:07: And this spirit maiden<0x10006:0xfecd>...<pause 15><0x10006:0x00cd>the one you\ncall Zelda...is another chosen one fated\nto be part of the same great mission.\n\nTherefore, should you wish to meet\nwith your friend, I highly recommend\nyou take up this sword before you\nset out to search for her.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo15_01:08: Does that information invigorate you?\nAre you ready to accept this sword?
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) Demo15_01:09: It seems that further persuasive\nmeasures will not be required.\n\n\nIn the name of my creator, draw the\nsword and raise it skyward.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo15_02:01: Recognition complete, <pause 15><0x10012:0x00000001>Master...\n\n\n\n<0x30001:0x><heroname>... <pause 15><0x10006:0xfecd>My <0x10012:0x00000004>master.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo15_02:02: <0x30001:0x><heroname>!
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo15_02:03: I've had my suspicions, but until now I\nwasn't sure.\n\n\nYet here we are in the<color red< Chamber of the\nSword>coloroff>, the very place where it was\nforetold the youth of legend would one\nday appear.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo15_02:04: It is said that this place was left to our\npeople by the goddess herself.\n\n\nThe very knowledge of this room's\nexistence is a secret passed down to a \nselect few each generation, along with\na handful of words...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo15_02:05: <color yellow white<When the light of the goddess's sword\nshines bright, the great apocalypse\nwill wake from its long slumber.\n\n<color yellow white<Do not fear, for it is then that a youth,\nguided by my hand, shall reveal himself\nin a place most sacred.<color yellow white<>coloroff>
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo15_02:06: It started days ago. The sword that I've\nkept secret all these years... It began to\ngive off a faint, otherworldly light.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo15_02:07: At first I was sure I was seeing things,\nhere alone with the sword. There was\nsimply no other explanation.\n\nI never dreamed the prophecy of\nlegend would come to pass in my\nlifetime.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo15_02:08: The words I have sworn to keep secret\nare coming true before my very eyes.\n\n\n<color yellow white<The youth will be guided by one born\nof the blade—one who is also youthful \nin likeness yet wise with knowledge\nimmeasurable.>coloroff>
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo15_02:09: Oral tradition, one of the least\nreliable methods of information\nretention and transmission.\n\nIt appears that critical sections of the\npassage have been lost over the\ngenerations.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo15_02:10: <color yellow white<The youth who draws forth the guiding\nsword shall be known as the goddess's\nchosen hero, and it is he who possesses\nan unbreakable spirit.\n<color yellow white<He shall be burdened with the task of\nabolishing the shadow of apocalypse\nfrom the land.

(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo15_02:11: Some of Father's old texts talk about a\nplace called the <color red<surface>coloroff>.\n\n\nThe old tales describe a whole world\nbelow, far more vast than Skyloft!
(unk1: 03, unk2: 5) Demo15_02:12: <0x10012:0x00000001>Master, you must embark on a great\njourney beneath the clouds to the vast\nrealm of the <color red<surface>coloroff>.\n\nIt is only through this journey that you\ncan fulfill the mission set before you\nby my creator, the goddess.\n\nIt is also the only method available for\nyou to reunite with the spirit maiden,\nhonorable Zelda.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Demo15_02:13: This is no easy task, <heroname>.\nThe world below is a forsaken place,\nand to reach it you must pierce the \ncloud barrier below.\nIn living memory, no one has ever\ndone this.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo15_02:14: This tablet will illuminate a path\nthrough the clouds to the land below.\n\n\nTake it, and place it within the altar\nbehind me.
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo15_02:15: You got the <color yellow<Emerald Tablet>coloroff>!\nThe weathered surface of this heavy stone\ntablet feels very old.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo15_02:16: <0x10012:0x00000001>Master, the first thing you must\ndo is hit the crest sitting in this\nroom with a <color red<Skyward Strike>coloroff>.\n\nThese blasts are formed of pure energy\nthat charges within your blade when\nyou lift it skyward.\n\nOnce you have charged your blade,\nface the crest and swing your sword\nto send out a powerful Skyward Strike.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo15_03:01: <0x10012:0x00000004>Master <heroname>, it is done.
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo15_03:02: Until now, a <color red<cloud >coloroff><color red<barrier >coloroff>created by\nthe goddess has separated the world\nyou know from the one below.\n\nThe tablet you placed in the altar has\nopened a small rift in the barrier.\nYou can use it to travel through the\nclouds to the realm below.\n<0x10012:0x00000002>I have recognized you as my master,\nand so it is my duty to follow you\nwherever you may go.\n\n<0x10012:0x00000002>I reside within your sword and will\naccompany you in your travels. \n<color green<Press >coloroff>(v) to summon me whenever you\nrequire my assistance.<0x10011:0x09cd>
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo15_03:03: <0x30001:0x><heroname>, listen a moment.\nThe nature of the great apocalypse \nmentioned in the old texts is a complete\nmystery to me.\nBut whatever it turns out to be, it \nseems that both you and Zelda have big\nroles to play in the destiny of this land.\n\nJust think—if what this Fi says is true,\nZelda is alive! Alive and no doubt\ncoming to terms with whatever it is the\ngoddess has in store for her.\nShould you heed the call of destiny,\nI don't know what dangers you may\nhave to face, <heroname>.\nEspecially down there...\nBut if you've decided to brave the\nunknown, please find my daughter and\nbring her back to me.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo15_03:04: What we've seen here today defies\nexplanation, but it is only the start of\nyour journey. Please, see it through\nand prove the legends true.\n[1-]OK![2-]No way.[3-]It's so much...
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo15_03:05: You do your people proud,\n<heroname>!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo15_03:06: I understand how you feel, but this is \ndestiny itself calling for you. You must\nnot run from it, <heroname>!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo15_03:07: Ah... I'm sorry, <heroname>.\nI know it's a heavy load to shoulder,\nbut you're the only one who can bear\nits weight.
(unk1: 03, unk2: 1) Demo15_03:08: Dawn is drawing near. It has been a\nlong night for the both of us, hasn't it?\n\n\nYou have a great journey before you,\n<heroname>, and those clothes...\nThey don't look up to the task.\n\nThe uniform you were to receive for\nwinning the race should be ready\nby now.\n\nA sturdy uniform like that will prove\nmuch more suitable for a long journey.\nYou'd better change before you go.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 3) Demo15_04:01: That green uniform is what our knights\nwill be wearing this year. To be honest,\nI've had my doubts about the color.\n\nBut oddly enough, seeing you wear this\nuniform, I can't imagine a more fitting\ncolor for you. It's as though you were\nborn to wear it.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Demo15_04:02: Take care on your journey, and be sure\nto stop by some of the shops at the\nbazaar here in town to equip yourself\nproperly for the travels ahead.\nI will return to my quarters and see if\nI can glean more useful information\nfrom the ancient texts.\n\nYou are always welcome to stop by if\nyou have questions. You and Zelda \nshall be in my prayers. May the \ngoddess watch over and guide you both.
