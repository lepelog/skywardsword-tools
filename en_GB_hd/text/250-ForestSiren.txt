(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) FR_SIREN_01: <0x10012:0x00000004>Master <heroname>.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 4) FR_SIREN_02: As expected, I cannot follow you into\nthis realm, for this trial calls out to\nyour mind<0x10012:0x00000002> alone.\n\nThis is the nature of places known as\n<color blue<Silent Realms>coloroff>. They are domains of the\nspirit, accessible only to the goddess's\nchosen hero.\nThis particular trial, <color blue<Farore's Silent\nRealm>coloroff>, tests the limits of your <color red<courage>coloroff>.\n\n\n<0x10012:0x00000001>Your spirit has temporarily separated\nfrom your physical body so that you\nmay undertake this challenge.\n\nTo reach the location of the flames\nthat will enhance your sword, it is\nnecessary for <0x10012:0x00000002>you to overcome this\ntrial and undergo spiritual growth.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) FR_SIREN_03: I will await your return in the outside\nworld.
(unk1: 04, unk2: 2) FR_SIREN_04: That is your <color yellow<<item 17>>coloroff>.\n\n\n\nWhen this vessel is full, it will signify\nyou have successfully completed the\ntrial, allowing your spirit to grow.\n\nThis, in turn, will allow the goddess\nto bless you with a <color red<new power>coloroff>.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 4) FR_SIREN_05: To fill the <color yellow<<item 17>>coloroff>, you need to\nsearch for something known as a\n<color yellow<<item 43>>coloroff>. There are many of \nthem spread across this strange world.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) FR_SIREN_05_2: <0x10012:0x00000002>Master, do you see the glowing\nobject just in front of you?
(unk1: 04, unk2: 2) FR_SIREN_05_3: That is a <color yellow<<item 43>>coloroff>.\nYou will need to collect <color red<15 >coloroff>of them.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 4) FR_SIREN_06: However, this is not as simple a task\nas it would seem. Your work in this\nrealm is referred to as a <color red<trial>coloroff> for\ngood reason.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) FR_SIREN_07_2: If you take even a single step outside\nthe protective circle you stand in, the\n<color red<Guardians >coloroff>of this realm will wake up\nand pursue you, <0x10012:0x00000002>Master.
(unk1: 04, unk2: 2) FR_SIREN_07_3: If a <color red<Guardian >coloroff>manages to land even a\nsingle hit on you, your spirit will\nshatter and you will fail the trial.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 4) FR_SIREN_07_4: You must collect the <color yellow<tears>coloroff> scattered\nthroughout this area and fill the\n<color yellow<<item 17> >coloroff>without being hit by\nan attack.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) FR_SIREN_08: <0x10012:0x00000005>Understood, Master.\n\n\n\nI will be eagerly awaiting your return\nin the outside world.\n\n\nMay the goddess watch over you,\n<0x10012:0x00000001>Master.
(unk1: 04, unk2: 2) FR_SIREN_09: Was my explanation clear, <0x10012:0x00000002>Master?\nDo you want me to explain again?\n[1-]Explain again.[2]I got it.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 4) FR_SIREN_15: Which topic do you wish to review?\n\n\n[1-]The <item 17>?[2-]Guardians?[3-]Silent Realm?[4]Never mind.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) FR_SIREN_16: <0x10012:0x00000005>Understood, Master.
(unk1: 04, unk2: 2) FR_SIREN_17: The <color blue<Silent Realm >coloroff>is a <color red<spirit world>coloroff> that\nonly the goddess's chosen hero is\nallowed to enter.\n\nYou have separated from your physical\nform and exist in this world as a spirit.\n\n\nThe tasks you perform here test your\nspiritual resolve. You must focus and\ncomplete the trial.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 4) FR_SIREN_10: When your <color yellow<<item 17>>coloroff> is filled with\n15 <color red<tears>coloroff>, your spirit will grow and you\nwill be blessed by the goddess with a\nnew power.\n<0x10012:0x00000002>Master, I will await your return in the\noutside world.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) FR_SIREN_20: <0x10012:0x00000004>Master <heroname>, I can\nunfortunately confirm that you\nhave failed to pass the trial.
(unk1: 04, unk2: 2) FR_SIREN_22: Collect all the <color yellow<tears>coloroff> within the Silent\nRealm. I shall await your return here.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 4) FR_SIREN_11: <0x10012:0x00000002>Master, so long as you have the will and\ndetermination, you can retry a trial\nas many times as you like.\n\nA good strategy is <color red<to find, but then\ndeliberately not pick up>coloroff>, the most-\neasily-accessible <color yellow<<color yellow<tears<color yellow< >coloroff>until you are\ndiscovered and really need one.\nCollect the 15 <color yellow<tears>coloroff> and complete the\ntrial. I will await your return in the\noutside world.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) FR_SIREN_12: The locations of <color yellow<tears>coloroff> you have\ngathered during your trial are\n<color red<marked on the map>coloroff>.\n\nYou will have an easier time\ncompleting your task if you first set\nout to discover the locations of all\n15 tears.
(unk1: 04, unk2: 2) FR_SIREN_21: <color red<Two types of Watchers >coloroff>patrol the\nrealm, looking for intruders. I highly\nsuggest you take caution.\n\nSo long as you do not step into their\nlight, you will remain undetected\nby <color red<flying Sky Watchers>coloroff>.\n\nHowever, the <color red<Earth Watchers>coloroff>, who\n<color red<hover near the ground>coloroff>, will give chase\nif you come too close to them, so <color red<stay\nalert >coloroff>and maintain a safe distance.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 4) FR_SIREN_13: <0x10012:0x00000001>Master, the chances of your not being\nthe chosen one are increasing...\n\n\nRepeated attempts at this trial have\nscattered your concentration and made\nyour performance erratic. I suggest\nyou rest awhile before trying again.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) FR_SIREN_14: I suggest using smart tactics to your\nadvantage. Try <color red<leaving easy-to-collect\ntears >coloroff>for when you are being pursued.
(unk1: 04, unk2: 2) FR_SIREN_23: The locations of <color yellow<tears >coloroff>that you have\npreviously collected will be <color red<marked\non the map>coloroff>, so make good use of that.\n\nConfirm the locations of all 15 tears\nfirst to increase your chances of\nsuccessfully completing the trial.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 4) FR_SIREN_24: <0x10012:0x00000001>Master, in addition to the <color red<Guardians>coloroff>\nwho will attack you, there are also two\ntypes of <color red<Watchers >coloroff>that search for\nintruders <color red<on the ground and in the sky>coloroff>.\nThe two types of Watchers exhibit\ndramatically different behavior, so be\nsure you understand how to avoid\ndetection by both.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) FR_SIREN_25: The unusual liquid substance that\ncovers that area is known as <color red<Waking\nWater>coloroff>, and it has certain unique\nproperties.\nIf you make contact with Waking\nWater, the <color red<Guardians will be\nimmediately alerted to your presence>coloroff>.\n\nPools of Waking Water are located all\nthroughout the area. I suggest you\nwatch where you step...
(unk1: 04, unk2: 2) RAIRYU_FR_SIREN_00: We're here, <heroname>!\nShow me what you've got!
