(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN2_048_8: When you have collected three parts\nof the Song of the Hero, return to\nthe great sky spirit, <color blue<Levias>coloroff>, and\ncomplete the Song of the Hero.\nIf the information you've gathered is\naccurate, doing this will open the path\nto the <color yellow white<Triforce>coloroff>.\n\nShould you go on to successfully obtain\nthe <color yellow white<Triforce>coloroff>, you must use its power to\nvanquish <color blue<Demise>coloroff>.\n\nThis is not only your ultimate goal but\nalso your destiny, <0x10012:0x00000002>Master.<entrypoint_6_296>
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) KEN2_049: You have learned the three parts of the\n<color red<Song of the Hero>coloroff> guarded by the\ndragons who reside on the surface.<entrypoint_6_249>
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN2_049_1: I recommend returning to <color blue<Levias>coloroff>, the \ngreat sky spirit, to hear the final part\nand complete the Song of the Hero.\n[1-]And after that?[2]Got it.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN2_049_2: I infer the completed Song of the\nHero will open a path to the Triforce.\n\n\nShould you go on to successfully obtain\nthe <color yellow white<Triforce>coloroff>, you must use its power to\nvanquish <color blue<Demise>coloroff>.<0x10012:0x00000002> \n\nDoing so is your ultimate goal and your\ndestiny, <0x10012:0x00000002>Master.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) KEN2_050: You are currently searching for the\n<color yellow white<Triforce>coloroff>, which has the power to\nvanquish <color blue<Demise>coloroff>.\n\nUtilize your <color green<dowsing>coloroff> ability with the\n<color red<Song of the Hero >coloroff>to find the fourth\n<color red<Trial Gate>coloroff>.<entrypoint_6_296>
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN2_051: <0x10012:0x00000002>Master, the <color red<<item 180> >coloroff>you\nreceived on completion of the final\ntrial is part of a pair.\n\nI infer that the matching second stone\nis somewhere within Skyloft. There is a\n90% chance that finding this stone will\nget you one step closer to the <color yellow white<Triforce>coloroff>.<entrypoint_6_296>
(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN2_052: <color blue<Ghirahim>coloroff> has abducted Zelda and fled\ninto the past with her. You must chase\nafter him as quickly as possible.<entrypoint_6_296>

(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN2_054: <color blue<Ghirahim>coloroff> has used the power of <color blue<Zelda>coloroff>'s\nsoul to revive <color blue<Demise>coloroff>. I'm afraid\nto report that further analysis of the\nsituation is impossible.<entrypoint_6_296>
(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN2_070: <color blue<Demise>coloroff> has once again broken the\nseal that binds him in an attempt to\nfree himself and return to full power.\n\nIf you fail to beat back this monster\nand gain more time to search for the\nTriforce, I estimate you have less than\na 1% chance of completing your quest.<entrypoint_6_296>
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) KEN2_090: I project that the soil in <color blue<Lanayru\nProvince>coloroff> will not provide enough\nnourishment for the Life Tree\nSeedling to grow and produce <color red<fruit>coloroff>. \nIn order to obtain this fruit, which the\nThunder Dragon seeks, you must find a\nplace to plant it where the tree can\ngrow strong <color red<over many long years>coloroff>.<entrypoint_6_296>
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN2_091: <0x10012:0x00000001>Master, I recommend you take the\n<color red<Life Tree Fruit >coloroff>to the Thunder Dragon\nin <color blue<Lanayru Province>coloroff>. \n\nI project a 90% chance that the\nThunder Dragon will agree to teach\nyou his <color red<part of the Song of the Hero\n>coloroff>if the fruit restores him to health.<entrypoint_6_296>
(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN2_092: <0x10012:0x00000001>Master, your primary objective is to\ndefeat the enemy here and overcome\nthe grueling task the Thunder Dragon,\n<color blue<Lanayru>coloroff>, has set before you.<entrypoint_6_296>
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) KEN2_093: You are currently searching for a \n<color red<sacred flame >coloroff>in <color blue<Eldin Province >coloroff>that \nwill enhance and augment your sword.\n\nYou have found a structure that is\nhighly likely to contain the sacred\nflame, but the entrance is blocked\nby a wall of flame.\nThere is an 80% chance that you will\nneed the Water Dragon's <color red<tub >coloroff>to\nsuccessfully extinguish the flames.<entrypoint_6_296>
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN2_094: Although details are currently unclear,\nI have detected a massive disturbance\nin the vicinity of the great pit in the \n<color blue<Sealed Grounds>coloroff>.\nYou must carry out the task the old\nwoman has asked of you and deal\nwith it.<entrypoint_6_296>
(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN2_095: I calculate a 99% probability that the\n<color yellow white<Triforce >coloroff>is somewhere in the structure\nthat appeared at the base of the Isle of\nthe Goddess.\nThe <color yellow white<Triforce >coloroff>has power capable of\nvanquishing <color blue<Demise>coloroff>. I recommend a\nthorough exploration of this\nstructure's interior areas.<entrypoint_6_296>

(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) KEN2_097: <color blue<Zelda>coloroff>'s presence seems to have\nvanished. I recommend a sweep \nof the area.<entrypoint_6_296>
(unk1: 00, unk2: 2) KEN2_098: I lack the data required to perform an\naccurate analysis of the current\nsituation.
