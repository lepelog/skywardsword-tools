SP_31_01: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02You've got quite an eye, friend. Those\n<y<<item08>>> do make a strong point!\n\n\nDo be careful not to accidentally shoot\npeople! That would be quite rude.\nThey cost a mere <r<20 Rupees>>.\n[1]OK! [2-]No, thanks.
SP_31_02: I do apologize, but I can't sell you\nthis unless you have a bow. It's\nstore policy, you see.

Plus, it will automatically\nrepair itself when it sustains damage!\n\nIt's a little fragile, but that shouldn't\nbe a problem for one as talented and\nagile as yourself! \n\nAt a cost of <r<500 Rupees>>, it's an\ninvestment...but an excellent one!\nCare to buy it?\n[1]OK! [2-]No, thanks.
SP_36: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02I see you have an interest in \n<y<10 >><y<<item39>>>! They\nare truly the perfectly matched\nprojectile for a slingshot.\nThey could be yours for <r<20 Rupees>>.\nCare to buy them today?\n[1]OK! [2-]No, thanks.
SP_36_01: My friend...you don't appear to have\na slingshot.\n\n\nI simply couldn't sell you these in good\nconscience if you do not have a\nslingshot. Perhaps I can interest you\nin some of my other wares...
SP_37: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02That's a <y<<item80>>>.\nWith this in your pouch, you can\ncarry 10 additional seeds.\n\nRecommended for slingshot\nenthusiasts! It costs <r<100 Rupees>>.\nDo we have a deal, friend?\n[1]OK![2-]No, thanks.
