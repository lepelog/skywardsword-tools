DS_SIREN_01: \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x04Master Link.
DS_SIREN_09: As you know by now, I cannot follow\nyou. The trial calls out to your mind\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02\nalone, as it is in every <b<Silent Realm>>.\n\nThis is the second trial, known as\n<b<Nayru's Silent Realm>>. It will test\nyour <r<wisdom>>, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master.\n\nYou must overcome this trial to find\nthe flames that will enhance your\nsword.
DS_SIREN_04: When your vessel is full, your spirit\nwill grow and you will be entrusted\nwith a <r<new power >>by the goddess.\n\nDo you have any questions?\n[1]Yes![2-]No.
DS_SIREN_25: Which topic do you wish to review?\n\n\n[1]The <item11>?[2]Guardians?[3]Waking Water?[4-]Never mind.
DS_SIREN_26: Do you have any further questions?\n\n[1]The <item11>?[2]Guardians?[3]Waking Water?[4-]Never mind.
DS_SIREN_28: Yes, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Master.
DS_SIREN_03: \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, I will await your return in the\noutside world.
DS_SIREN_05: Yes, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Master.\n\n\n\nTo fill the <y<<item11>>>, you need to\nlocate and collect every <y<<item2D>\n>>scattered across this Silent Realm.
DS_SIREN_15: \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, do you see the glowing\nobject just in front of you?
DS_SIREN_16: That is a <y<<item2D>>>.\nYou will need to collect <r<15 >>of them.
DS_SIREN_07: \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Understood, Master.\nAllow me to explain.
DS_SIREN_18: If you take even a single step outside\nthe protective circle you stand in, the\n<r<Guardians >>of this realm will wake up\nand pursue you, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master.
DS_SIREN_19: If a <r<Guardian >>manages to land even\none attack on you, your spirit will\nshatter and you will fail the trial.
DS_SIREN_27: The unusual liquid substance that\ncovers that area is known as Waking\nWater, and it has certain unique\nproperties.\nIf you make contact with Waking\nWater, the <r<Guardians will be\nimmediately alerted to your presence>>.\n\nPools of Waking Water are located all\nthroughout the area. I suggest you\nwatch where you step...
DS_SIREN_20_1: You must collect the <y<tears>> scattered\nthroughout this area and fill the\n<y<<item11> >>without\nbeing hit by an attack.
DS_SIREN_08: 
DS_SIREN_10: When your <y<<item11>>> is filled with\n15 <r<tears>>, your spirit will grow and you\nwill be blessed by the goddess with a\nnew power.\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, I will await your return in the\noutside world.
DS_SIREN_20: \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x04Master Link, I can\nunfortunately confirm that you\nhave failed to pass the trial.
DS_SIREN_22: Collect all the <y<tears>> within the Silent\nRealm. I shall await your return here.
DS_SIREN_11: \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, so long as you have the will and\ndetermination, you can retry a trial\nas many times as you like.\n \nA good strategy is <r<to find, but then\ndeliberately not pick up>>, the most-\neasily-accessible <y<<y<tears<y< >>until you are\ndiscovered and really need one.\nCollect the 15 <y<tears>> and complete the\ntrial. I will await your return in the\noutside world.
DS_SIREN_12: The locations of <y<tears>> you have\ngathered during your trial are\n<r<marked on the map>>.\n\nYou will have an easier time\ncompleting your task if you\nfirst set out to discover the\nlocations of all 15 tears.
DS_SIREN_21: <r<Two types of Watchers >>patrol the\nrealm, looking for intruders. I highly\nsuggest you take caution.\n\nSo long as you do not step into their\nlight, you will remain undetected\nby <r<flying Sky Watchers>>.\n\nHowever, the <r<Earth Watchers>>, who\n<r<hover near the ground>>, will give chase\nif you come too close to them, so <r<stay\nalert >>and maintain a safe distance.
DS_SIREN_13: \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, the chances of your not being\nthe chosen one are increasing...\n\n\nRepeated attempts at this trial have\nscattered your concentration and made\nyour performance erratic. I suggest\nyou rest awhile before trying again.
DS_SIREN_14: I suggest using smart tactics to your\nadvantage. Try <r<leaving easy-to-collect\ntears >>for when you are being pursued.
DS_SIREN_23: The locations of <y<tears >>that you have\npreviously collected will be <r<marked\non the map>>, so make good use of that.\n\nConfirm the locations of all 15 tears\nfirst to increase your chances of\nsuccessfully completing the trial.
DS_SIREN_24: \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, in addition to the <r<Guardians>>\nwho will attack you, there are also two\ntypes of <r<Watchers >>that search for\nintruders <r<on the ground and in the sky>>.\nThe two types of Watchers exhibit\ndramatically different behavior, so be\nsure you understand how to avoid\ndetection by both.
