(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) ANA_01_02: Hope you dig up lots of Rupees!\nJust be careful what you're poking\ndown in the dirt. Could go KA-BOOM!\nSo uh...good luck!
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) ANA_01_03: Come back soon!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) ANA_01_04: You haven't got enough Rupees.\nSave some up and then come back!

(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) ANA_01_07: Hello there! Thanks for stopping by.\nFirst time here, am I right?

(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) ANA_01_08: Here's how it works: you go on and dig\nup ALL the Rupees you can! Well,\nuntil you dig your mitts into a\nspicy little bomb...\nWould you like to... <0x10009:0x00141614>Oh, I'm sorry,\nbut you don't look so good. Why not\ncome back when you have some\nmore hearts?
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) ANA_01_16: If you like, use the seat over there\nand take a load off.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) ANA_01_09: The Beginner course has less spots to\nburrow into, but it's great for\nfirst-timers!
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) ANA_01_10: It's <color red<30 Rupees >coloroff>to play. Want to give\nit a go?\n[1-]You bet![2]Nope.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) ANA_01_11: The Intermediate course has plenty of\nspots to sink your mitts into, but watch\nout for <color yellow<Rupoors>coloroff>.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) ANA_01_12: It'll cost you <color red<50 Rupees >coloroff>a go.\nInterested?\n[1-]Sure.[2]Nope.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) ANA_01_13: The Expert course has more bombs,\nsure, but more valuable Rupees too.\nIt could be highly profitable...\nor highly explosive.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) ANA_01_14: Each round costs <color red<70 Rupees>coloroff>. Do you\ndare to try?\n[1-]Sure.[2]Nope.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) ANA_01_15: So which course will it be?\n[1-]Beginner.[2-]Intermediate.[3-]Expert.[4]None.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) ANA_02_01: You should try again. How about\nanother go?\n[1-]Beginner.[2-]Intermediate.[3-]Expert.[4]I'm done.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) ANA_02_02: You didn't dig up even a single Rupee?\nNot a one? You poor little digger...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) ANA_02_03: Looks like you took a heavy loss.\nYep. Well, I'm sorry, my friend.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) ANA_02_04: You didn't quite turn a profit.\nChalk that up to bad luck, I say.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) ANA_02_05: You broke even! No loss. No gain.\nAt least you had yourself some fun, eh?\nAnd you got to see an explosion!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) ANA_02_06: You made a small profit. Nice digging!
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) ANA_02_07: Wow, you made yourself a fortune!\nCongratulations!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) ANA_02_08: Well, I'm just stupefied! You dug up all\nthe Rupees! Listen—you earned this\nprize. Take it!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) ANA_02_09: Here's your grand Rupee total: <color red<<numeric arg0 0>>coloroff>!
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) ANA_02_13: Let's see how many Rupees you\nmanaged to dig up...
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) ANA_02_10: Here's a useful tip: <color red<low-value Rupees \n>coloroff>have only <color red<a few bad spots >coloroff>nearby, \nso you can relax a little.\n\nBut the <color red<higher the value of the Rupee>coloroff>,\nthe <color red<more bad spots >coloroff>are nearby.\nBe careful of the spaces surrounding\na valuable Rupee!\nIf your first burrow digs up a bomb...<pause 20>\nyou'll just have to admit defeat and\ntry again. But don't let it get to you!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) ANA_02_11: You look a bit tired out. Why not rest\nup until you get a few hearts back?
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) ANA_02_12: There's a stool over there. It ain't\nexactly lined with satin pillows, but\ngo ahead and take a load off.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) ANA_03_01: Sorry. There's a time limit here,\nand you just hit it. Time's up!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) ANA_03_02: I wish you'd hurry up about it.\nYour time's almost up...
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) ANA_04_01: <0x10009:0x00080a04>Ah, you're taking a break? Too much\nsuspense for you?\n\n\nWell then, will you take a load off and\nchat with me a bit?[1-]OK.[2]Not now.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 0) ANA_04_02: <0x10009:0x00101319>Oh...that's too bad. Anyway, once\nyou've rested up, I hope you'll consider\ngiving <color blue<Thrill Digger >coloroff>a try.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) ANA_04_03: <0x10009:0x000f110c>Oh, yes! OK, OK...is there anything\nyou want to ask me?<0x10009:0x00080aff>[1-]Who are you?[2-]Are you floating?[3-]Is it too bright for you?[4]Nothing.<0x10009:0x001316ff>
