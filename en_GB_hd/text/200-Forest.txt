(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) F1_SWORD_00_3: <0x10005:0x004b0000>It is logical that the lush plant life and\nwater resources have attracted animal\nspecies to the region.

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) F1_SWORD_01_2: <0x10012:0x00000005>Yes, Master. Based on the creature's\ncharacteristics, I must conclude that it\nis a peaceful, forest-dwelling animal\nknown as a <color blue<Kikwi>coloroff>.\nKikwis are intelligent beings capable of\nspeech<pause 15>. However, such a creature could\nobviously not be confused with Zelda.\n\nIt is unclear why such a creature would\nelicit a dowsing response attuned to\nZelda.

(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) F1_SWORD_01_3: The probability of this life-form being\nZelda is 5%, so I must conclude that \nthis is, in fact, not Zelda but a peaceful\nforest creature known as a Kikwi.\nKikwis are highly intelligent beings, \ncapable of speech.<pause 15> Yes, upon further\nobservation...clearly not Zelda.\n\nIt is unclear why such a creature would\nelicit a dowsing response attuned to\nZelda.

(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) F1_SWORD_06_2: An analysis of dowsing readings\nindicates that there are no additional\nKikwis in this area.\n\nI suggest you speak with the Kikwi\nelder.

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) F1_SWORD_09: <0x10012:0x00000004>Master, my calculations indicate\nthere is an 80% probability that a\nsacred flame lies beyond this gate.\n\nI have also deduced that the power of\nthe goddess the Kikwi hermit referred\nto is in fact the <color red<Skyward Strike>coloroff>.\n\nCharge your sword while standing in\nfront of the gate and use its energy to\n<color green<draw the missing portion of the symbol>coloroff>.

(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) F1_SWORD_10_2: <sound 4>I have marked the position of the\nKikwi known as Machi. Please\nconfirm your current location.
(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) F1_SWORD_10_3: Furthermore, my analysis suggests that\nthis Kikwi most likely produces a\nfalse-positive dowsing reaction due to\nprevious direct contact with Zelda.\nUsing this hypothesis, I theorize there\nis an 85% chance that the Kikwi elder\nwill also generate a dowsing reaction\nfor the same reason.\nI propose you continue dowsing to\nsearch for Zelda.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) F1_SWORD_11: Learning that Zelda is no longer with\nthe Kikwi elder is an unfortunate\nsetback.<pause 15> But he may still have useful\ninformation.\nTaking this into account, I calculate\nan 85% probability that your quest\nwill be aided if you find the lost Kikwis\nfor the elder.\nTo expedite your search for these\nforest-dwelling creatures, I have\nadded <sound 4><color red<Kikwis>coloroff> as a dowsing option.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) F1_SWORD_11_2: Do you need me to explain how to\nswitch dowsing targets? \n[1-]Yes![2]No, thanks.

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) F1_SWORD_11_4: Additionally, I will mark any Kikwis\nyou discover on your map and disable\ndowsing readings for them. That way,\nyou will not revisit the same Kikwis.\nThis concludes my explanation. When\nready, please begin your search for\nthe missing Kikwis.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) F1_SWORD_12: I have marked<sound 4> the location of Oolo\nthe Kikwi on your map. However,\ndowsing readings indicate there are\nstill Kikwis to search for.

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) F1_SWORD_16_3: It would be very unwise to display\noverconfidence here. Within the walls\nof this place, no one will come to\nyour aid.

(unk1: 00, unk2: 1) F1_SWORD_16_8: Now we should continue the search for\nZelda.
