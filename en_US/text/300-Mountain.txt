(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) MT_F1_SWORD_14: <0x10005:0x005a0000>Approximately 65% of the region is\ncovered by lava. It is inhabited by a\nlarge number of creatures that thrive\nin the extreme heat and direct flame.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) MT_F1_SWORD_15: <0x10005:0x005a0000>Please exercise caution with flammable\nmaterials such as <color red<wood >coloroff>and <color red<fabric>coloroff>.

(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) MT_F1_SWORD_04: <0x10012:0x00000005>My calculations agree, Master. \nThere is a 90% probability the figure in\nquestion was indeed Zelda.

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_02: With these, you should be able to get to\nthe top of that ledge right behind me.<0x1000A:0x000b00cd>\nJust try digging in that hole below the\nledge. You're in for a surprise!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_44: <0x10008:0xffcd>It's not like I'm using these things, you know?\nAnd they're WAY better than Rupees!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_35: I just hope your friend hasn't been\ncaptured by those red guys. Here's\nhoping everything's OK.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_03: Hey, I'm hoping you find your friend\nall in one piece!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_04: Hmm... I'm sure they buried it around\nhere someplace, but I can't find it.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_05: Yo, <color blue<Ledd>coloroff>! This is the place, ain't it?\nSo what is it they buried again?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_06: A <color red<key>coloroff>! <color red<K-E-Y>coloroff>, <color red<KEY>coloroff>!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_45: They busted up the <color red<key to that door >coloroff>and\nhid the pieces all over the place.\n\n\nI'm telling you, one of the <color red<five pieces >coloroff>is\nburied right around here.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_07: Hey, that reminds me... That<color red< strange\nblonde girl in the weird clothes >coloroff><sound 4>got\ntaken away too.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_08: <0x10009:0x10110d0b>That's right! I bet they got something\nreally valuable stashed in there.\n\n\n<0x10009:0x10090800>And that blonde girl they took is\nprobably part of their master plan too.\nI'm telling you, I can smell the riches\nfrom here!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_09: So what're you saying we do once we\nfind all the pieces to the key?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_10: <0x10009:0x10110d09>Whaddya think, igneous? We sneak\ninside and take all the treasure we\ncan carry!

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_12: What? Um...<pause 30>
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_13: Just sayin'.<pause 30>

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_16_03: <0x10008:0xffcd>Yeah, whatever, Mr. Too Scared to Dig in\nthe Dark.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_16_04: Anyway, if you're looking for treasure,\nyou should stay clear of those red guys.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_17: <0x10009:0x00110d11>Huh? You're looking for a friend?\nNOT treasure?\n\n\n<0x10009:0x00ffff0e>So that must have been your pal that\npassed by earlier, <color red<sprinting by >coloroff>without\nso much as a glance in this direction.<sound 4>\n\nIt was sorta a blur of movement, so I\ndidn't get a real good look, but I knew\nit wasn't one of those red creeps.\n\nYour pal must have gone straight up\nhere, so why don't you follow?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_18: Us <color blue<Mogmas >coloroff>have claimed this territory\nto search around for riches. We're\nwhat you'd call <color blue<treasure hunters>coloroff>.\n\nThere are loads of these red, blue, and\ngreen stones called <color yellow<Rupees >coloroff>around\nhere. Sometimes you can even find\n<color red<silver >coloroff>and<color red< gold >coloroff>ones too.\nAnd while they ain't technically\ntreasure, you can also find these tough\n<color red<mineral chunks>coloroff>. I bet you could <color red<use 'em\nto make stuff>coloroff>.\nSince you're here and all, you might as\nwell look around, right?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_19: The one that went running through\nhere looked kinda like you.\n\n\nI don't think he was dressed in green,\nthough.

You ain't one of those red guys.\n<pause 15><0x10009:0x10090807>Don't creep up on me like that!\nAlmost had to tackle ya there.\n\n<0x10009:0x100aff00>Didn't mean to yell at ya, but those red\njerks moved in and have been stinking\nup our turf, ya know?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_21_02: They came up through that hole back\nthere, so I sunk the road leading to it\nin lava. That'll stop more of 'em\nfrom moving in, I'd say.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_21_03: Of course, we can tunnel underneath\nit, so it's no sweat for us.\n<0x10009:0x1011080b>Pretty clever, right?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_21_04: So stay away from the plug that's\nholding back the lava. It'll do more\nthan singe your brows off. Bye now!

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_26: What do you think? Makes planning\nwhere to dig a bit easier, don't it?\n\n\n<0x10009:0x00ffff09>But at the end of the day, it comes down\nto luck. YOUR luck. So just do the\nbest you can, and cross your fingers\nor something.

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_50: <0x10009:0x00ffff00><color yellow<Bomb flowers>coloroff>. You're joking, right?\n<0x1000A:0x001100cd>Those are them growing right over\nthere.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) MT_F1_MZ_52: You pick one with (A), and the fuse\nlights. A few seconds later...BOOM!\nYou don't wanna stop and sniff this\nflower. Dangerous plants, believe me.\n<0x10009:0x0011080b>But once you learn to use them, they're\na powerful weapon. Us <color blue<Mogmas >coloroff>are\ncrazy about 'em!\n\n<0x10009:0x00ffffff>You can <color green<toss>coloroff> and <color green<roll >coloroff>them the same\nway you do jars.

You do know <color green<how to roll\nand throw >coloroff>stuff, right?\n[1-]Uh-huh.[2-]Not really...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_53: <0x10009:0x0011020b>That's what I figured. You can pick\nsome pretty powerful ones in this area.\n\n\n<0x10009:0x00ffffff><0x1000A:0x001100cd>Look! There are some right over there!\nTake as many as you want.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) MT_F1_MZ_55: I'm sure you already know this, but\nonce you pick a flower with (A), the\nfuse starts burning.

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_71: <0x10009:0x00090809>Of course you do!

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_F1_MZ_48: I'm stating the obvious here, but you\ncan <color green<pick up and put down >coloroff><color yellow<bomb flowers\n>coloroff>with (A), the same way you do with jars.\n\nWhen you're holding something,\n<color green<point up and swing >coloroff>the Wii Remote\ndown to throw it.\n\nTo roll it, <color green<point down and swing >coloroff>the\nWii Remote up.\n\n\nGo on and practice a bit with those\n<color yellow<bomb flowers >coloroff>over there.
