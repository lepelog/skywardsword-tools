KEN3_016: 
KEN3_017: 
KEN3_018: 
KEN3_019: This is <b<Hylia>>. My apologies, Master.\nDue to numerous unknown elements\nhere, no analysis is currently possible.
KEN3_020: This is <b<Skyview Temple>>. I have\ndetected an abundance of powerful,\nhostile auras in the local and\nsurrounding areas.\nI project that these monsters possess\na very high intelligence. They will\nlikely employ a variety of cunning\nattacks.
KEN3_021: This is the <b<Earth Temple>>. There is an\nabundance of powerful, hostile auras\nin the surrounding area.\n\nWatch for <b<Bomb Flowers >>in this area.\nThey explode in reaction to various\nforms of stimuli.

KEN3_023: These are the <b<Sealed Grounds>>.\nThe aura of a powerful and extremely\nhostile monster fills the entire area.\n\nI have no details on this monster as of \nyet, but the battlefield is quite large,\nso monitor your <r<stamina gauge\n>>closely.
KEN3_024: These are the <b<Sealed Grounds>>.\nThe aura of a powerful and extremely\nhostile monster fills the entire area.\n\nI have no details on this monster as of \nyet, but the battlefield is quite large,\nso monitor your <r<stamina gauge\n>>closely.
KEN3_025: These are the <b<Sealed Grounds>>.\nThe aura of a powerful and extremely\nhostile monster fills the entire area.\n\nI have no details on this monster as of\nyet, but I project that the mechanism\ncreated by <b<Groose>> will prove effective.
KEN3_026: You are currently located in the\n<b<Ancient Cistern>>. The aura of an\nextremely powerful and hostile\nmonster pervades the area.\nMovement is restricted by the rows of\ncolumns. I highly suggest you use your\nsuperior dexterity to evade enemy\nattacks.
KEN3_027: You are currently standing on the deck\nof the <b<Sandship>>. The aura of an\nexceptionally strong monster\npervades the area.\nTake care not to accidentally tumble\noverboard, as there is nothing but\nocean surrounding the vessel.
KEN3_028: This is the <b<Fire Sanctuary>>. Readings\nindicate an extremely hostile aura\nin the area.\n\nMy analysis of this aura leads me to\nconclude that this foe is highly\nintelligent. He will likely employ\na variety of cunning attacks.
KEN3_029: We are inside the <b<thunderhead>>.\nAnalysis reveals a parasitical monster\non the great spirit of the sky, Levias,\nhas caused him to go mad.\nWhen in combat, be careful of strong\nwinds and unstable footholds.
KEN3_030: These are the <b<Sealed Grounds>> of the\npast. I detect an extremely powerful\nand exceptionally hostile aura in the\nimmediate area.\nAura analysis has revealed that this\nfoe is highly intelligent. He will likely\nemploy a variety of cunning attacks.
KEN3_031: I have no record of this place.\nI sense no hostile auras other\nthan <b<Demise>>.\n\nMy projections indicate your current\nlocation is a unique space under the\ncontrol of <b<Demise>>'s magic. <r<I do not\nbelieve >><r<Skyward Strikes are possible>>.
KEN3_032: This is a subterranean corridor that\nlinks <b<Lanayru Mining Facility >>to the\n<b<Temple of Time>>.\n\nI detect no monsters here, so I project\nthe probability you will engage in\ncombat here is under 5%.
KEN3_033: This is one section of <b<Sky Keep>>.\nI detect many monsters of various\ntypes and abilities concentrated in\nthis small area.
KEN3_034: This is one section of <b<Sky Keep>>.\nVigilance is highly recommended here.\nI detect many strong monsters.
KEN3_035: You are located inside <b<Sky Keep>>.\nI detect many fire- and magic-wielding\nmonsters here. Avoid physical contact.
KEN3_036: This is one section of <b<Sky Keep>>.\nThe remains of ancient monsters are\nscattered around this area. \n\nI recommend careful attention to your\nsurroundings while transporting the\nTimeshift Orb.
KEN3_037: This is one section of <b<Sky Keep>>.\nThe remains of ancient monsters are\nscattered around this area. \n\nI recommend careful attention to your\nsurroundings while transporting the\nTimeshift Orb.
KEN3_038: In this area of <b<Sky Keep>>, there are\nmany complicated contraptions.\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, your wisdom will be tested\nhere.
KEN3_039: You are currently located in <b<Sky Keep>>.\nThe pathway here is too narrow\nto dodge enemy attacks.\n\nI recommend making good use of your\n<g<shield bash>>, as I project it will be\ndifficult to find heart-replenishment\nopportunities.
KEN3_040: You are located inside <b<Sky Keep>>.\nNo monsters exist here, though I infer\nexploring this area will not be easy.\n\nTo aid you, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, I will increase\nanalytical granularity and provide\n<r<situational analysis for each section>>.
KEN3_041: 
KEN3_042: These are the <b<Lanayru Caves>>. I detect\nno monsters in the area.
KEN3_043: This is <b<Eldin Volcano>>. You will likely\nencounter a limited number of\nmonsters here that are capable of\nshooting fire arrows from a distance.\nIn the alarming event you catch on\nfire, you can extinguish yourself using\na <g<roll or spin attack>>.
KEN3_044: This is <b<Skyview Temple>>. I detect an\nincrease in the number of hostile auras\nwithin the structure since our last visit.\nDo not let your guard down.
KEN3_045: This is <b<Farore's Flame Chamber>>.\nThere are no monsters here.
KEN3_046: This is <b<Din's Flame Chamber>>.\nThere are no monsters here.
KEN3_047: These are the <b<Sealed Grounds>>. This\nis where the Isle of the Goddess came\ndown. There are no monsters here.

KEN3_100: My projections indicate that equipping\na sword is sufficient for combat at\nthis location.\n\nYou could also consider stocking your\npouch with helpful items.
KEN3_101: You are sufficiently equipped to\nexplore this area. You can safely swap\na portion of the combat-oriented pouch\nitems for other support pouch items.
KEN3_102: In the bazaar, you can use Rupees\nand treasures dropped by defeated\nmonsters to buy and upgrade items.
KEN3_103: Pouch items that focus on heart\nreplenishment are unnecessary in this\narea. I recommend removing non-\ncombat pouch items.
KEN3_104: Be prepared to engage monsters that\nattack in hordes.
KEN3_105: Use of your limited supply of pouch\nitems should be avoided when possible.
KEN3_106: Certain monsters will drop treasure\nupon defeat, but I would discourage\nyou from taking any unnecessary risks\nwhen seeking treasure in this fashion.
KEN3_107: There is little here that will put your\nlife in danger. I recommend using this\nopportunity to sharpen your sword\ntechniques in smaller battles.
KEN3_108: The structure of this enclosed space\nwill hamper the speed with which you\ndiscover monsters, increasing the\nchance of unexpected damage to 75%.\nI recommend keeping a large quantity\nof potions with you.
KEN3_109: Your life should not be in danger as\nlong as you avoid engaging multiple\nenemies in combat.
KEN3_110: Your current selection of pouch items\ndoes not sufficiently protect you.\nI recommend carrying defensive and\nhealth-replenishing pouch items.
KEN3_111: My projections indicate the danger to\nyour life will be limited if you remain\ncalm and engage monsters confidently.\n\nUse your health-replenishing items\nsparingly.
KEN3_112: Use of weapons and items is not\npossible underwater. You must\nprotect yourself by other means.
KEN3_113: Analysis indicates use of your current\nselection of items will be limited due to\nthe large sections of this area that\nare underwater.
KEN3_114: Analysis indicates use of your current\nselection of items will be limited due to\nthe large sections of this area that\nare underwater.
KEN3_115: You cannot use weapons and items\nunderwater. If your hearts are low,\nsearch for a place where you can get\nout of the water and recuperate.
KEN3_116: Your pouch items are suitable to this\nenvironment, but caution is advised\ndue to the presence of airborne,\nland-dwelling, and marine monsters.
KEN3_117: Your current selection of pouch items\nis highly suitable for this environment.\n\n\nYou will be able to respond to a wide\nrange of circumstances. This is ideal\nfor a facility as complex as this one.
KEN3_118: Analysis indicates a large number of\nmonsters with varying characteristics.\n\n\nYou will need to prepare a suitable\nloadout of pouch items and adapt to\ncircumstances as you proceed.
KEN3_119: You are somewhat prepared for this\narea, but due to the presence of air,\nland, and aquatic enemies, I suggest\nyou exercise caution.
KEN3_120: You will not be able to use items and\nweapons while underwater. Search for\nother ways to defend yourself.
KEN3_121: I recommend keeping <y<Air Potions>>\nor <y<Heart Potions>> handy in case of\noxygen depletion and any resulting\nheart loss.
KEN3_122: I recommend keeping <y<Air Potions>>\nor <y<Heart Potions>> handy in case of\noxygen depletion and any resulting\nheart loss.
KEN3_123: Your selection of pouch items is highly\nsuited to this environment. However,\nyou will not be able to use pouch items\nwhile underwater.
KEN3_124: You will sustain injury when your\nclothes are set on fire. I recommend\ncarrying sufficient recovery items\nin your pouch.
KEN3_125: I project a high probability that you\nwill sustain damage from both\nmonsters and magma.\n\nI recommend carrying recovery and\ndefensive items in your pouch.
KEN3_126: With your current selection of items,\nI estimate an 85% chance of serious\nhealth loss before finding treasure or\nRupees.
KEN3_127: There is minimal danger when you\nare set on fire by an enemy attack,\nprovided you react calmly and quickly.
KEN3_128: You will continue to take damage while\nyour clothing is on fire. I recommend\ncarrying plenty of recovery items in\nyour pouch.
KEN3_129: Even minor injuries can become life\nthreatening if you sustain enough of\nthem. Remain cautious.
KEN3_130: It would be dangerous to continue\nexploring this area with your current\npouch items. I recommend you carry\nrecovery and defensive pouch items.
KEN3_131: There is minimal danger when you\nare set on fire by an enemy attack,\nprovided you react calmly and quickly.
KEN3_132: You will continue to take damage while\nyour clothing is on fire. I recommend\ncarrying plenty of recovery items.
KEN3_133: Even minor injuries can become life\nthreatening if you sustain enough of\nthem. Remain cautious.

KEN3_135: There is minimal danger when you\nare set on fire by an enemy attack,\nprovided you react calmly and quickly.
KEN3_136: When you are affected by a <r<curse>>, you\nwill be unable to use your sword and\nshield for a short time.\n\nIn the event that you become cursed,\nI highly recommend you retreat from\nthe area.
KEN3_137: The layout of the sanctuary is quite\ncomplex. It will be less dangerous to\nexplore in stages, frequently returning\nto <b<Skyloft>> to rest and resupply.
KEN3_138: My projections indicate you may have\ndifficulty fighting with the pouch\nitems you are carrying.\n\nI highly recommend that you save\nyour progress whenever you encounter\na <r<bird statue>>.
KEN3_139: You are equipped to handle the loss of\na few hearts, but you must remain\ncautious. There are a large number\nof strong foes in the area.
KEN3_140: It is possible to attack <b<Bokoblins>>\npositioned on towers and high ground\nusing your <r<bow>> and <r<bombs>>.\n\nYour chance of a successful attack is\nhigher if you strike before you are\nnoticed.
KEN3_141: <b<Bokoblins>> are constructing a fortress\non high ground. I recommend\nemploying weapons with\nlong-range attack capability.
KEN3_142: You are carrying mostly noncombat\nitems in your pouch, so I currently\nproject a 65% probability that you will\nencounter difficult combat conditions.\nI recommend making sure you are\nfully equipped to handle long-range\nattack capability.
KEN3_143: Most of the enemies in this area are\n<b<Bokoblins>>, so I project you are in\nlittle danger of running out of hearts.\n\nAttack is the best defense here.
KEN3_144: Monsters can appear without warning.\nYou will need to be ready to switch\nbetween your sword and other\nweapons at a moment's notice.
KEN3_145: <b<Lanayru Province>>, our current\nlocation, is vast in size. I recommend\ncareful rationing of items that do\nnot regenerate themselves.
KEN3_146: You are not well suited to this\nenvironment. I recommend avoiding\nunnecessary combat.
KEN3_147: Your gear is suitable for this vast\ndesert environment. You should be\nable to explore relatively safely.
KEN3_148: There are many monsters in this area\nthat can attack from a distance.\nBe prepared to lose hearts.
KEN3_149: You are equipped to adapt to a\nvariety of circumstances.\n\n\nHowever, the possibility of trouble\nwill increase if you alter your current\nbalance of pouch items.
KEN3_150: Because of the significant number of\npowerful enemies in the area, I highly\nrecommend carrying pouch items that\nfocus on recovery and defense.
KEN3_151: You are carrying a number of\npouch items that are ineffective in\nbattle. This may lead to the unplanned\nconsumption of recovery pouch items.
KEN3_152: It will be difficult to explore the vast\n<b<Lanayru Sand Sea >>with only combat-\nfocused items in your pouch.\n\nYou'll need to take measures to\npreserve and recover hearts when\nnecessary.
KEN3_153: Your preparations for preserving and\nrecovering hearts are insufficient. If\nyou want to proceed as is, be cautious\nin both exploration and combat.
KEN3_154: The <b<Lanayru Sand Sea>> is quite vast.\nI recommend prioritizing equipment\nthat will help preserve and recover\nhearts.
KEN3_155: Your gear is more suited to this area\nthan other types. Prioritize heart\npreservation when exploring the\n<b<<b<Lanayru<b< Sand Sea>>.
KEN3_156: The inside of the ship features many\nsmall rooms and corridors. Close\ncombat is expected, so take equipment\nthat mitigates heart depletion.
KEN3_157: Your pouch-item loadout can adapt\nwell to many scenarios, but you can\nincrease suitability by 10% by adding\ndamage-mitigating pouch items.
KEN3_158: The inside of the ship has narrow\ncorridors where combat cannot be\navoided. I project you will lose a\nnumber of hearts in this area.
KEN3_159: Your pouch items correctly focus on\ndefense and recovery. Be aware, \nthough, that close combat will likely be\nunavoidable in the ship's corridors.
KEN3_160: Analysis shows close combat will\nbe frequent here. Equipment suited to\nlong-range combat will be ineffective.\nYou will need hearts for the assault.
KEN3_161: My projections indicate you are likely\nto be injured in combat because you\nwill be traversing a number of narrow\nplatforms here.\nI recommend carrying pouch items that\nare ideal for defense and heart\nrecovery.
KEN3_162: My projections indicate you are likely\nto be injured in combat because you\nwill be traversing a number of narrow\nplatforms here.\nI recommend carrying pouch items that\nare ideal for defense and heart\nrecovery.
KEN3_163: Analysis indicates this place is home to\nhordes of monsters. If you encounter\nthem, I suggest employing heart-\nrecovery and preservation measures.
KEN3_164: 
KEN3_165: 
KEN3_166: 
KEN3_167: 
KEN3_168: I detect no particular danger here.
KEN3_169: 
KEN3_170: 
KEN3_171: 
KEN3_172: 
KEN3_173: 
KEN3_174: 
KEN3_175: 
KEN3_176: Monster numbers here are unknown.\nYou may find yourself in danger if you\ndo not have adequate defensive and\nrecovery capabilities.
KEN3_177: You do not have enough <y<Heart Potions>>.\nI recommend you do whatever is\nnecessary to obtain every single <y<heart\n>>that a monster drops.
KEN3_178: Monster numbers here are unknown.\nYou may find yourself in danger if you\ndo not have adequate defensive and\nrecovery capabilities.
KEN3_179: Monster numbers here are unknown.\nEquipment that will assist you with\nhearts may be the best choice.
KEN3_180: I cannot offer my usual analysis\nbecause you are currently engaged in\na challenge created by the Thunder\nDragon Lanayru.
KEN3_181: I do not have any relevant information\nto report at this time.
KEN3_182: In this area, pouch items that enhance\nlong-distance weapons, such as the\nbow, will be most effective.
KEN3_183: You have a high probability of\nsustaining injury when you approach\nmonsters that shoot fire arrows. Carry\nhealth-recovery pouch items.
KEN3_186: 
KEN3_184: You could be ambushed by fire-arrow-\nshooting monsters at any time.\nI suggest using items that allow you\nto deal swiftly with these monsters.
KEN3_185: You have a high probability of\nsustaining injury when you approach\nmonsters that shoot fire arrows. Only\na few potions may not be enough.
KEN3_200: To make matters worse, your Wooden\nShield is not well suited to defend you\nfrom fire-based attacks.<pause0F> I do not\nrecommend that you equip it.
KEN3_201: Furthermore, your Iron Shield will not\ndefend you against electrical attacks.<pause0F>\nI do not recommend that you use it.
KEN3_202: 
KEN3_203: 
KEN3_204: 
KEN3_205: 
KEN3_300: \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, your current selection of\npouch items is <string arg0>.

KEN3_404: 
KEN3_500: \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, your current selection of\npouch items is <string arg0>.
KEN3_501: Suitability to current location is <numeric arg0>%.
KEN3_600: Your offensive options are limited\nwhile battling with this monster.\n\n\nI recommend carrying more recovery\npouch items and potions to ensure\neffectiveness.
KEN3_601: My analysis suggests you should\nattempt to anticipate your opponent's\nmoves and react quickly.\n\nHowever, I suggest focusing on defense\nrather than offense because of the lack\nof recovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_602: My analysis reveals that you will be\nmuch more prepared for this area if\nyou increase the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_603: In a situation where a monster utilizes\nseveral types of attacks, you are likely\nto take significant damage until you\nfully understand their strategy.\nI recommend doing what you can to\npreserve your hearts while you focus\non quickly analyzing attack patterns.
KEN3_604: You will be able to mount an aggressive\nassault on your opponents with the\ncurrent high proportion of combat\nitems in your pouch.\nHowever, your ability to recover is\nlimited, so you should avoid taking\ndamage whenever possible.
KEN3_605: You have plenty of recovery and\nattack pouch items. If you utilize them\neffectively, you will have an 80%\nchance of success in the battle.\nHowever, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, you must still be\nvery careful. This monster has superior\noffensive and defensive capabilities.
KEN3_606: My analysis indicates you will be better\nsuited to engaging this enemy in battle\nif you increase the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_607: I theorize that ascertaining this\nmonster's pattern of attack should\nbe comparatively easy.\n\nHowever, your stock of pouch items\nthat allow you to attack this enemy is\nlimited. As such, there is a 75% chance\nthis battle will drag on.
KEN3_608: There is a 90% probability that the\nmajority of your weaponry will be\nineffective against your current foe.\n\nTaking sufficient heart-recovery\nmeasures will be vital for the lengthy\nbattle that is likely to ensue.
KEN3_609: I calculate an 80% probability that the\nbattle will drag on due to your limited\noffensive options and relatively small\nwindows for attack.\nMy analysis suggests that you should\nremove any pouch items not needed\nfor battle.
KEN3_610: My analysis indicates you will be better\nsuited to engaging this enemy in battle\nif you increase the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_611: I calculate an 80% probability that the\nbattle will drag on due to your limited\noffensive options and relatively small\nwindows for attack.\nSince you are likely to sustain a lot of\ninjuries, finding the right moment to\nrecover hearts will be critical.
KEN3_612: The efficient use of pouch items will\ngive you quite an advantage.\n\n\nIt is probable that you will eventually\nhave to engage in direct combat.\nWhen your hearts are low, you should\ntake appropriate precautions.
KEN3_613: You currently carry a mixture of\nuseful and suboptimal pouch items.\n\n\nI recommend a careful assessment of\nthe pouch items you are carrying.
KEN3_614: My analysis indicates you will be better\nsuited to engaging this enemy in battle\nif you increase the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_615: The monster is attempting to leave the\nconfines of the <b<Sealed Grounds >>and\nhead out into the land.\n\nYou have a limited time frame in which\nto imprison it. Doing so may force you\nto put yourself in harm's way, so be\nprepared to sustain some damage.
KEN3_616: The aura of the monster here is\noverwhelmingly powerful. Do not rely\non the support pouch items to be\nparticularly effective in your battle.
KEN3_617: You currently carry a mix of useful\nand suboptimal pouch items.\nI recommend you remove items that\ndo not directly serve your purposes.
KEN3_618: My analysis indicates you will be better\nsuited to engaging this enemy in battle\nif you increase the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_619: The monster is attempting to leave the\nconfines of the <b<Sealed Grounds >>and\nhead out into the land.\n\nYou have a limited time frame in which\nto imprison it. Doing so may force you\nto put yourself in harm's way, so be\nprepared to sustain some damage.
KEN3_620: I have detected the aura of an\nextremely powerful monster.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, my analysis has revealed\nsomething troubling. Neither your\nsword nor your items will likely be\nvery effective against this enemy.
KEN3_621: I have concluded that the majority\nof the items in your pouch will be\nineffective during your battle against\nthis monster.\nThe monster itself appears to be\nevolving, growing larger and more\npowerful with each moment.
KEN3_622: My analysis indicates you will be better\nsuited to engaging this enemy in battle\nif you increase the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_623: This monster is overwhelmingly\npowerful. It will not be effective to\nchallenge it directly in your current\nstate and with the sword you wield.\nI recommend reevaluating and\nchanging your entire fighting style.
KEN3_624: You have a limited number of effective\noffensive options. The probability\nthat your battle equipment will be\ncompletely ineffective is 90%.\nThere is also a great danger that your\nheart-recovery pouch items will be\ninsufficient, which may prove lethal if\nyou are unable to end the fight quickly.
KEN3_625: You currently carry a mix of useful\nand suboptimal pouch items.\n\n\nI recommend you remove items that\ndo not directly serve your purposes.
KEN3_626: My analysis indicates you will be better\nsuited to engaging this enemy in battle\nif you increase the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_627: I calculate an 80% probability that the\nbattle will drag on due to your limited\noffensive options and relatively small\nwindows for attack.\nMy analysis indicates you are likely to\nincur significant damage, so finding\nthe right time to recover hearts will be\nimperative.
