(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_01: <0x10012:0x00000004>Master <heroname>...
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_02: You stand within <color blue<Din's Silent Realm>coloroff>,\nthe third trial. It will test the limits of\nyour <color red<power>coloroff>.\n\nTo locate the last flame that will\nenhance your sword, you must first\ncomplete this final challenge and\nachieve spiritual growth once again.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_04: When your vessel is full, your spirit\nwill grow and you will be entrusted\nwith a <color red<new power >coloroff>by the goddess.\n\nDo you have any questions?\n[1-]Yes![2]No.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_25: Which topic do you wish to review?\n\n\n[1-]The <item 17>?[2-]Guardians?[3-]Waking Water?[4]Never mind.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_26: Do you have any further questions?\n\n[1-]The <item 17>?[2-]Guardians?[3-]Waking Water?[4]Never mind.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_28: Understood, <0x10012:0x00000005>Master.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_03: <0x10012:0x00000002>Master, I await your return in the\noutside world.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_05: Yes, <0x10012:0x00000005>Master.\n\n\n\nTo fill the <color yellow<<item 17>>coloroff>, you need to\nlocate and collect every <color yellow<<item 44> \n>coloroff>scattered across this Silent Realm.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_15: <0x10012:0x00000002>Master, do you see the glowing\nobject a ways in front of you?
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_16: That is a <color yellow<<item 44>>coloroff>.\nYou will need to collect <color red<15 >coloroff>of them.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_07: <0x10012:0x00000005>Understood, Master.\nAllow me to explain.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_17: If you take even a single step outside\nthe protective circle you stand in, the\n<color red<Guardians >coloroff>of this realm will wake up\nand pursue you, <0x10012:0x00000002>Master.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_18: If a <color red<Guardian >coloroff>manages to land even a\nsingle hit on you, your spirit will\nshatter and you will fail the trial.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_19: You must collect the <color yellow<tears>coloroff> scattered\nthroughout this area and fill the\n<color yellow<<item 17> >coloroff>without\nbeing hit by an attack.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_27: The unusual liquid substance that\ncovers that area is known as <color red<Waking\nWater>coloroff>, and it has certain unique\nproperties.\nIf you make contact with Waking\nWater, the <color red<Guardians will be\nimmediately alerted to your presence>coloroff>.\n\nPools of Waking Water are located all\nthroughout the area. I suggest you\nwatch where you step...
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_08: 
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_10: When your <color yellow<<item 17>>coloroff> is filled with\n15 <color red<tears>coloroff>, your spirit will grow and you\nwill be blessed by the goddess with a\nnew power.\n<0x10012:0x00000002>Master, I will await your return in the\noutside world.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_20: <0x10012:0x00000004>Master <heroname>, I can\nunfortunately confirm that you\nhave failed to pass the trial.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_22: Collect all the <color yellow<tears>coloroff> within the Silent\nRealm. I shall await your return here.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_11: <0x10012:0x00000002>Master, so long as you have the will and\ndetermination, you can retry a trial\nas many times as you like.\n\nA good strategy is <color red<to find, but then\ndeliberately not pick up>coloroff>, the most-\neasily-accessible <color yellow<<color yellow<tears<color yellow< >coloroff>until you are\ndiscovered and really need one.\nCollect the 15 <color yellow<tears>coloroff> and complete the\ntrial. I will await your return in the\noutside world.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_12: The locations of <color yellow<tears>coloroff> you have\ngathered during your trial are\n<color red<marked on the map>coloroff>.\n\nYou will have an easier time\ncompleting your task if you\nfirst set out to discover the\nlocations of all 15 tears.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_21: <color red<Two types of Watchers >coloroff>patrol the\nrealm, looking for intruders. I highly\nsuggest you take caution.\n\nSo long as you do not step into their\nlight, you will remain undetected\nby <color red<flying Sky Watchers>coloroff>.\n\nHowever, the <color red<Earth Watchers>coloroff>, who\n<color red<hover near the ground>coloroff>, will give chase\nif you come too close to them, so <color red<stay\nalert >coloroff>and maintain a safe distance.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_13: <0x10012:0x00000001>Master, the chances of your not being\nthe chosen one are increasing...\n\n\nRepeated attempts at this trial have\nscattered your concentration and made\nyour performance erratic. I suggest\nyou rest awhile before trying again.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_14: I suggest using smart tactics to your\nadvantage. Try <color red<leaving easy-to-collect\ntears >coloroff>for when you are being pursued.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_23: The locations of <color yellow<tears >coloroff>that you have\npreviously collected will be <color red<marked\non the map>coloroff>, so make good use of that.\n\nConfirm the locations of all 15 tears\nfirst to increase your chances of\nsuccessfully completing the trial.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 2) MT_SIREN_24: <0x10012:0x00000001>Master, in addition to the <color red<Guardians>coloroff>\nwho will attack you, there are also two\ntypes of <color red<Watchers >coloroff>that search for\nintruders <color red<on the ground and in the sky>coloroff>.\nThe two types of Watchers exhibit\ndramatically different behavior, so be\nsure you understand how to avoid\ndetection by both.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 2) RAIRYU_MT_SIREN_00: We're here, <heroname>!\nShow me what you've got!
