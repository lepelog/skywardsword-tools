(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_01: <0x10009:0x00000001><0x10006:0xfecd>Ah...<pause 15> The traveler descended from\nthe clouds above. I welcome you,\nchild of fate.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_01_2: <0x10009:0x00000008><0x10006:0xfecd>Tell me, what is your name?\n\n\n\n...<pause 40><0x30001:0x><heroname>?\nAh, <heroname>. Good.\nVery good.\n\nI sense you have already gained control\nover the sacred power that fills your\nsword when <color green<pointed skyward>coloroff>. The\n<sound 4><color red<Skyward Strike>coloroff> is yours to command.\n<0x10009:0x0000000b>It is proof that you are fit to bear the\nblade you carry, the <color blue<Goddess Sword>coloroff>.\n\n\n<0x10006:0xffcd>I have sat here for many years waiting\nfor you to arrive. All so that I could\nfulfill my purpose as your guide.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_02: You stand under the roof of the Sealed\nTemple, a place built by the goddess\nan eternity ago.\n\nYour arrival here was predestined\nmany, many years ago.\n\n\nThe spirit maiden you seek arrived \nhere shortly before you, descending to\nthis land in a shower of light.\n\nThere's no doubting it. The gears of\nfate have begun to turn.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_03: <0x10009:0x0000000a>Yet all is not as it should be. The spirit\nmaiden was not meant to reach this\nland in the manner she did.\n\nI feel an evil power working in the\nshadows. It moves to warp the destiny\nof which you two are a part.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_03_01: <0x10009:0x000eff08><0x30001:0x><heroname>...<pause 30>You are concerned\nfor the spirit maiden and seek her\nwhereabouts, yes?\n\n...That is understandable, but for now\nyou must focus on moving forward.\nThat girl has her own purpose she must\npursue, as do you.\nShe set out for <color blue<Faron Woods>coloroff> to discover\nthat destiny for herself, and you must\nfollow.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_04: <0x10009:0x000eff00>Show me your map.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) Inpa_05: The (X) upon your map marks the path\nthat will lead you to <color blue<Faron Woods>coloroff>.\n\n\nYou will be traveling in unfamiliar\nland. Many monsters have settled here,\nand a map may not prove guidance\nenough for your journey.\nAnd so I will give you the power to \ncreate <color red<beacons>coloroff>.\n\n\nWhen a beacon is marked on your map,\na column of light will stand at that \nlocation. It will act as your waypoint \nfrom afar.\nPoint at the (X) and press (C) to place\na beacon.<0x10011:0x06cd>
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_05_02: <0x10009:0x00000003>Though you cannot see it from where\nwe are, a beacon stands outside to \nguide you. Leave the temple through\nthe front doors, and see for yourself.\nWhen you no longer have a use for\na beacon, you can remove it from your\nmap by pressing (C)<0x10011:0x06cd>.\n\nUse your beacons well, and you will\nnever fear getting lost.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_05_03: <0x10009:0x00000006>You haven't set a beacon over (X) yet.\n\n\n\nTo remove a beacon from your map, \npoint at it and press (C) once more.<0x10011:0x06cd>\n\n\nIf you aim to be more accurate with\nthe placement of your beacons, zoom in\nwith (A) before you lay one down.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_06: <0x10009:0x000eff03>Go now. You must head into Faron\nWoods and chase after the spirit\nmaiden...the one you call <color blue<Zelda>coloroff>.\n\nOn your way out, take the contents of\nthe <color red<treasure chest>coloroff> within this room.\nWhat you find there should prove\nuseful to you on your journey.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_06_01: Go on now. Point at (X) and press (C) to\nplace a beacon at that location.<0x10011:0x06cd>
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_06_02: You are ready. Leave through the door\nbefore you, and head into the woods.\nI wish you safe travel.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_06_03: <0x10009:0x00001303>The door that leads to Faron Woods\nis open now. Leave through the door\nto my left, and head for the woods.\n\nAll the questions you have now will be\nanswered in time. For now, you must\ngo, <heroname>. Walk bravely.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_06_04: <0x10009:0x00001303>Know that all the questions you have\nnow will be answered in time. For now,\n<heroname>, go bravely!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_06_05: <0x10009:0x00000003>No doubt you've seen the great\nspiraling pit just outside the temple.\nKnow that something sleeps sealed\naway in the depths of that place.\nDo not worry yourself about what\nslumbers there. It will be made known\nto you when the time is right.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_06_06: <0x10009:0x0000000a>We shall find more time to talk later.\nFor now, you must go.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 2) Inpa_07: <0x10009:0x0400003d>Huh? You gotta be kidding me,\nGrannie!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_07_01: <0x10009:0x04000002>You're messing with me. Say it again,\nI dare you!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_08: <0x10009:0x0e00000a>I only speak the truth. You are not the\none who will save her. The spirit\nmaiden, your <color blue<Zelda>coloroff>, can only be\nsaved by another.\nIt has been his fate to do this thing,\nand in doing so save us. As it was\ndecided long before you were brought\ncrying into this world.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_09: <0x10009:0x0400003e><0x10008:0x01cd>Shut it, Grannie!\n\n\n\nYou obviously don't know me well,\n'cause if you did, you'd know that if\nanyone's gonna save <color blue<Zelda>coloroff>, it's\nGroose!\nHow could it not be me? Plus, if it ain't\nme, why would I even be here? Pffft.\nIf I'm not up to the job of being\nthe hero, just who is?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_09_01: <0x10009:0x0400001e>Huh?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_10: <0x10009:0x04003218>Oh...now I getcha.\n\n\n\n<0x10009:0x040d0a00><0x30001:0x><heroname>, Grannie here has\nbeen trying to tell me you're gonna be\nthe big hero who rescues Zelda.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_10_01: <0x10009:0x0400003c>What a joke! Look, all I've heard so\nfar is a bunch of babbling about\ndestiny, but that's a load of garbage.\n\n<0x10009:0x040b0a00>I know you, and you're no hero,\nshrimp!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_10_02: <0x10009:0x04000038><0x10008:0x01cd>Waaaah!<0x10005:0x002d0000>
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_11: <0x10009:0x0e000008>Greetings, <heroname>. Were you\nable to catch up with <color blue<Zelda>coloroff>?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_12: <0x10009:0x0e0eff05>Ah, I see. So the guardian was there as\nwell, was she?\n\n\nThe one you saw by Zelda's side is\nknown as <color blue<Impa>coloroff>. She is a being sent\nforth by the <color blue<goddess >coloroff>to aid Zelda in \nher quest.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_13: The two have traveled somewhere in\norder to accomplish the great task\ndestiny has set before them.\n\nHowever, now that Impa has destroyed\nthe gate that they used, there is only\none way left to find them.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_14: <0x10009:0x0e0eff00>You must make use of the <color blue<harp >coloroff>given\nto you by Zelda.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_15: <0x10009:0x0e000004>Come back, <heroname>!\nThe disturbance we're feeling is not in\nthat direction.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_16: Hurry. Take the door across from me,\nand see what is happening outside!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_17: ...Do you need to equip yourself before\nfacing the unknown? Very well. I will\nnot stop you, but you must hurry back!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_21: <0x10009:0x00000003>When the three sacred flames have\nimbued your sword, only then will the\nGate of Time open for you.\n\nThe clue that will lead you to the\nflames is woven into the song of your\nhomeland known as the <color red<Ballad of the\nGoddess>coloroff>. You must return to Skyloft!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_22: <0x10009:0x0000000a>The seal's strength will not last. Sooner\nor later the great beast shall break its\nshackles once more.\n\nFortunately, I hear Groose has been\nhard at work preparing something for\nits next assault.\n\n<0x30001:0x><heroname>, you must move fast.\nYou must imbue your sword with the\npower of the three sacred flames.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) Inpa_26: The “<color blue<Ballad of the Goddess>coloroff>.\" Based on\nmy projections, this is likely the song\nZelda sang on the day of the Wing\nCeremony.\nI calculate an 85% probability that\nsomeone associated with the academy\nwill be able to provide additional\ninformation about this song.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_37: <0x10009:0x0010160f>Ah, your sword!\n\n\n\n<0x10009:0x00000b00>There can be no doubt. The sacred\nflames have purified this blade.\nWell done, <heroname>. That\nsword holds tremendous power.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_38: <0x10009:0x0001ff07>That power is a sacred <color red<force>coloroff>.\n\n\n\n<0x10009:0x00000b00>It is a divine power left to us by the\ngods of old. The same power that is\nspoken of in the Ballad of the Goddess.\n\nTo look upon you is to see that same\ngreat power, now flowing through you\nand the sword you carry.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_39: <0x10009:0x00001603>Come, <heroname>. You must\nnow open the Gate of Time.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_39_01: Now that the sacred <color red<force>coloroff> dwells\nwithin your blade, strike the Gate of\nTime with a <color red<Skyward Strike >coloroff>and\nit will surely awaken.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_39_02: Climb upon the pedestal, and <color green<show\nthe gate your sword's power>coloroff>!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_39_03: <0x10009:0x00000007>Now that the sacred force dwells within\nyour blade, hit the Gate of Time with\na <color red<Skyward Strike>coloroff> and it will surely\nawaken.\nClimb upon the pedestal, and <color green<show\nthe gate your sword's power>coloroff>!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_10: <0x10009:0x00000004>Yo, <heroname>! Saw the rail\ntrack I put up outside, eh?\n\n\n<0x10009:0x00000b00>What's it for? Duh huh... Oh, you'll see\nbefore long!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_40_01: <0x10009:0x040a321f><0x10008:0x01cd>WHOA-HO!<0x10005:0x001e0000>
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_40_02: <0x10009:0x0e00000a>No... I fear the <color red<seal has given way once\nagain>coloroff>. That <color red<terrible beast>coloroff> is awakening\neven as we speak.\n\nIt is likely that the monster reacted to\nthe sacred power given off by your\nsword.\n\n<0x10009:0x0e010b00>I wish it had not happened, but there\nwas no other way to open the gate.\nSo it goes...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_41_1: <0x10009:0x0e101600><0x30001:0x><heroname>, you must imprison\nthe beast once again.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_11: <0x10009:0x0400030d>All right! Bring it on!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_12: <0x10009:0x040f2f0f>This is what I've been waiting for.\nIt's time to break out my new toy!\nTrust me, that flabby bag of teeth\ndoesn't stand a chance.\n<0x10009:0x040b3101>Well? What are we waiting for?\nI'm heading out there!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_42: <0x10009:0x0000000a>The beast is awakening from its\nslumber.\n\n\n<0x30001:0x><heroname>, you must seal the\nbeast away once more!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_43: <0x10009:0x0e00000a><0x30001:0x><heroname>, you must not loose\nanother <color red<Skyward Strike >coloroff>now!\n\n\nWere you to do so, it could speed up the\nmonster's awakening.\n\n\nWe will return to the gate later. For\nthe moment, you must focus your\nefforts on <color red<restoring the seal>coloroff> that\nholds the beast captive.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_45: <0x10009:0x0e000003>It seems you were successful in\nimprisoning the monster again.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_45_01: You have my thanks,\n<heroname>.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_45_02: As do you, <color blue<Groose>coloroff>.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_45_03: I do not wish to dwell on what may have\nhappened if you two hadn't been here.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_46: <0x10009:0x0400000d>Duh huh, aww...you give me too much\ncredit, Grannie.\n\n\nYou were the one who got me to stop\nfeeling sorry for myself and put my\nenergy into doing what I could to help.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_47: <0x10009:0x0e080b0b>I did what was necessary to get you to\nrealize your full potential.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_48: <0x10009:0x0e000007><0x30001:0x><heroname>, you must wonder\njust what it is you've been fighting out\nthere in the great pit.\n\nThere is much I could tell you, but\nsuffice to say it is the root of the evil\nwe face. When you pass through the\nGate of Time, you shall learn more.\n<0x10009:0x0e010b00>We may seal it and reseal it into its\nprison a thousand times, but it will\nalways shatter the bonds that confine\nit. Such is its awesome power.\nWe must destroy it at its source or\nsuffer this fate again and again.\n\n\n<0x10009:0x0e100b00>There is no time to lose. Hit the gate\nwith a Skyward Strike.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_50: <0x10009:0x040d0206>Come on, already! Charge that sword\nof yours with that sacred force stuff\nGrannie was talkin' about, and <color green<zap>coloroff> the\nGate of Time!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_50_01: Right on, Grannie.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_51: <0x10009:0x0e010007>...Indeed. Now, <heroname>, go.\nGo to the gate.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_52: <0x10009:0x00100003><0x30001:0x><heroname>, it is time!\nOpen the Gate of Time, and travel\nto the other side.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_53: <0x10009:0x00101606><0x30001:0x><heroname>, what are you doing?\nDid you meet with Zelda on the other\nside of the door?\n\n<0x10009:0x00140b00>If not, you must go back through!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_13: <0x10009:0x000c020d>Come on, already! Charge that sword\nof yours with that sacred force stuff\nGrannie was talkin' about, and <color green<zap>coloroff> the\nGate of Time!\nI bet you <color blue<Zelda>coloroff>'s just on the other side\nof that gate, wonderin' where you are.\nYou shouldn't make the little lady\nwait, <heroname>! Go on!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_14: <0x10009:0x000c0206>I bet you <color blue<Zelda>coloroff>'s just on the other side\nof that gate, wondering where you are.\nYou shouldn't make the little lady\nwait, <heroname>! Go on!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_54: <0x10009:0x0e010103>So you've returned.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_55: Then you know everything...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_55_01: On the other side of that gate, <color blue<Zelda>coloroff>\nwaits, suspended in a sleep without end.\nBut do not despair, for she is still\nalive and well.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_56: True to legend, the Triforce is the one\nthing with the power to vanquish\nDemise. It is thought to have been\nhidden within Skyloft by the goddess. \n<0x10009:0x0e010b00>Sadly, that is all we know of where it\nrests. <pause 15>All other clues to its whereabouts\nhave been lost to the ages.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_56_01: <0x10009:0x0e140b00><0x30001:0x><heroname>, you have likely\ncome to the same conclusion, but I will\nspell it out just the same.\n\nThe key to finding the Triforce must\nbe in <color blue<Skyloft>coloroff>.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_57: <0x10009:0x0e080b07>Go now, <heroname>. \nFind the Triforce.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_58: The clues to finding the Triforce are\nin Skyloft.\n\n\n<0x10009:0x0e000007>Go forth and find the Triforce.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 2) Bad_15: <0x10009:0x0401ff04><0x10008:0x01cd>Whoa! Whoa there! Hold up!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_15_01: <0x10009:0x0403ff00><0x30001:0x><heroname>, there's something I\ngotta tell you.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_15_02: <0x10009:0x0403ff02>So, Zelda... How's she holding up?\nWas she OK when you saw her?\n\n[1-]She's great![2-]Actually...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_15_03: She was? Oh, good to hear.\n\n\n\n<0x10009:0x04030200>...But she's still stuck there till this\nwhole mess blows over, huh?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_15_04: <0x10009:0x04001400>That's terrible. It's gotta be so hard for\nthe poor girl.\n\n\n<0x10009:0x04030200>But you're going to do something about\nthis mess, right?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_16: <0x10009:0x040e0d09><0x30001:0x><heroname>...I've made up my\nmind. I'm not going back.\n\n\n<0x10009:0x04000200>I'm staying right here with Grannie.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_16_01: <0x10009:0x0400ff0d>Aww, don't look so bummed out. Do I\nlook sad? Nah, I'm doing what I want\nto do!\n\n<0x10009:0x04000200>I don't know how to explain it. I got\nthis feeling in my belly that there's\nwork to do here.\n\nSomeone's gotta watch that big, ugly\nmonster,<0x10009:0x04000211> and someone's gotta make\nsure Grannie's doing all right.\n\nIt ain't as action packed as what you're\ndoing, but maybe this is my destiny.\nKnow what I mean?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_16_02: <0x10009:0x04030d08>Besides, it's not so bad here. Living up\nin the sky was OK, I guess, but don't\nyou just love the way it smells down\nhere? What? That's not weird to say!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_16_03: <0x10009:0x040d0209>Check it out.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_16_04: <0x10009:0x04040208>Zelda and Grannie have brought life\nback to the land here.\n\n\nI bet even the weakest <color red<sapling >coloroff>could\ngrow into one beast of a tree in soil\nlike this. It'd brighten this place up a\nlittle too.\n<0x10009:0x040d0211>I mean, sure, it'd take a few years for\nit to grow, but as far as I'm concerned,\nI got nothing but time.\n\n<0x10009:0x04000012>It's weird to say out loud, but that's\njust how I feel right now.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_16_05: <0x10009:0x040d022e>So...yeah...you know. When you get\nback to Skyloft, do me a favor and let\npeople know I'm doing OK down here.\n\n<0x10009:0x04000e00>Cawlin and Strich might get a little\nemotional since they look up to me,\nbut you tell them I'm happy, OK?\n\n<0x10009:0x04000209>Thanks, <heroname>.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_20: <0x10009:0x00000002>Don't let me down. I'm counting on\nyou to help <color blue<Zelda>coloroff>, <heroname>!\n\n\nOh, by the way, I've been thinking\nabout how nice it'd be to have a <color red<tree\n>coloroff>here, but I don't have a seedling or\nanything. You seen one I can plant?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_21: <0x10009:0x000d022e>It's great to finally get a sapling here\nand all,<pause 20> but it's going to take <color red<ages >coloroff>to\nget this thing to grow tall!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_22: <0x10009:0x000d0f0a>Oh yeah! Now this is a tree I could\nlook at all day! It's like a symbol for\nthis temple...or something!\n\n<0x10009:0x00030200>Every time I stare at it, my jaw starts\nhanging open and I get this weird,\nhappy feeling.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_23: <0x10009:0x000d0204>Hey, <heroname>, now that is a\nserious seedling. Why didn't you tell\nme you had that thing on you?\n\n<0x10009:0x00000e0e>I'm no expert, but it seems like the\nperfect fit for this temple. If you\nplant it here, it'll grow for sure.\n\n<0x10009:0x00030200>Only downside is, <pause 10>it's gonna take\nbasically forever for a seedling that\nbig to grow into a full tree.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Bad_24: <0x10009:0x00000000>You gotta chase after that creep,\n<heroname>! <color blue<Zelda>coloroff>'s counting\non you!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_59: <0x10009:0x00000005>You seek the dragons? When the Song\nof the Hero is complete, the path to\nthe Triforce shall be illuminated?\nThen take care and be on your way!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_60: <0x10009:0x0000000a>That terrible <color red<monster>coloroff> begins to stir yet\nagain! It appears that even though\nZelda has lent her power to strengthen\nit, the seal will soon reach its limit.\nSo be it. You and Groose must work\ntogether to beat that foul beast back\ninto its prison and restore the seal!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_61: <0x10009:0x0000000a><0x30001:0x><heroname>, work with Groose to\nimprison that monster once more!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_62: <0x10009:0x00000005>Searching after the three dragons, are\nyou? I seem to recall a dragon who\nlived in the far reaches of the desert...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_63: <0x10009:0x0e000003>The beast has been sealed into its\nprison for a third time.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_63_01: <0x30001:0x><heroname>, Groose... You have\nboth done well.\n\n\nBut I fear we can't dwell on your\nsuccess. The strength of the seal\nseems to wane with each escape.\n\nWe are almost out of time,\n<heroname>. Are you close to\ndiscovering the Triforce?\n[1-]Yes![2-]Actually...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_64: <pause 25>...I see. You must seek out the three\ndragons and complete the Song of the\nHero to find the Triforce.\n\nIt is right your search led you here.\nThe <color blue<Faron Woods>coloroff> are close by.\n\n\n<0x10009:0x0e00000a>Unfortunately, there has been an\nunusual turn of events in the woods...\n\n\n<0x10009:0x0e010b00>I am unsure of what happened, but a\nshort while ago, I noticed the path to\nthe woods was completely flooded.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_64_01: To protect the land here, I closed the\n<color red<gate leading to the woods>coloroff> and drove\nback the water with a simple seal.\n\nThe seal will only hold as long as the\ngate remains closed, meaning you\nwill not be able to open it without\nflooding these lands.\nGiven this situation, I am at a loss\nas to how you can enter the woods. 
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_65: <0x10009:0x0400000d>Heh! Is that all? Consider the problem\nsolved!\n\n\nSee, that last battle with big ugly got\nme thinking about other ways to use\nthe <color red<Groosenator>coloroff>!\n\nJust climb up into that bad boy, and I'll\ngive you a “lift\" over to the woods,\nall right?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Inpa_65_01: <0x10009:0x040c0202>I'll run ahead and get her prepped for\nyou! Come see me when you're ready\nto take a little flight.

(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) Fay_01: My analysis indicates this location is\nideally suited to growing your seedling.\n\n\nHowever, I project that planting the\nseedling in <color red<this time >coloroff>will make it take\nfar too long for the seedling to grow\ninto a tree capable of producing fruit.
