ANA_01_01: Do you like money? How about\nexplosions? Well, dig up some Rupees\nbefore you hit a bomb in a suspenseful\ngame of <b<Thrill Digger>>! Want to try it?\n[1]Beginner![2]Intermediate![3]Expert![4-]No, thanks.
ANA_01_02: Hope you dig up lots of Rupees!\nJust be careful what you're poking\ndown in the dirt. Could go KA-BOOM!\nSo uh...good luck!
ANA_01_03: Come back soon!
ANA_01_04: You haven't got enough Rupees.\nSave some up and then come back!
ANA_01_06: Welcome!
ANA_01_07: Hello there! Thanks for stopping by.\nFirst time here, am I right?
ANA_01_07_01: The name's <b<Tubert>>. Nice to meet you! \nI run this little game I like to call\n<r<Thrill Digger>>!
ANA_01_08: Here's how it works: you go on and dig\nup ALL the Rupees you can! Well,\nuntil you dig your mitts into a\nspicy little bomb...\nWould you like to... \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x14\x1614Oh, I'm sorry,\nbut you don't look so good. Why not\ncome back when you have some\nmore hearts?
ANA_01_16: If you like, use the seat over there\nand take a load off.
ANA_01_09: The Beginner course has less spots to\nburrow into, but it's great for\nfirst-timers!
ANA_01_10: It's <r<30 Rupees >>to play. Want to give\nit a go?\n[1]You bet![2-]Nope.
ANA_01_11: The Intermediate course has plenty of\nspots to sink your mitts into, but watch\nout for <y<Rupoors>>.
ANA_01_12: It'll cost you <r<50 Rupees >>a go.\nInterested?\n[1]Sure.[2-]Nope.
ANA_01_13: The Expert course has more bombs,\nsure, but more valuable Rupees too.\nIt could be highly profitable...\nor highly explosive.
ANA_01_14: Each round costs <r<70 Rupees>>. Do you\ndare to try?\n[1]Sure.[2-]Nope.
ANA_01_15: So which course will it be?\n[1]Beginner.[2]Intermediate.[3]Expert.[4-]None.
ANA_02_01: You should try again. How about\nanother go?\n[1]Beginner.[2]Intermediate.[3]Expert.[4-]I'm done.
ANA_02_02: You didn't dig up even a single Rupee?\nNot a one? You poor little digger...
ANA_02_03: Looks like you took a heavy loss.\nYep. Well, I'm sorry, my friend.
ANA_02_04: You didn't quite turn a profit.\nChalk that up to bad luck, I say.
ANA_02_05: You broke even! No loss. No gain.\nAt least you had yourself some fun, eh?\nAnd you got to see an explosion!
ANA_02_06: You made a small profit. Nice digging!
ANA_02_07: Wow, you made yourself a fortune!\nCongratulations!
ANA_02_08: Well, I'm just stupefied! You dug up all\nthe Rupees! Listen--you earned this\nprize. Take it!
ANA_02_09: Here's your grand Rupee total: <r<<numeric arg0>>>!
ANA_02_13: Let's see how many Rupees you\nmanaged to dig up...
ANA_02_10: Here's a useful tip: <r<low-value Rupees \n>>have only <r<a few bad spots >>nearby, \nso you can relax a little.\n\nBut the <r<higher the value of the Rupee>>,\nthe <r<more bad spots >>are nearby.\nBe careful of the spaces surrounding\na valuable Rupee!\nIf your first burrow digs up a bomb...<pause14>\nyou'll just have to admit defeat and\ntry again. But don't let it get to you!
ANA_02_11: You look a bit tired out. Why not rest\nup until you get a few hearts back?
ANA_02_12: There's a stool over there. It ain't\nexactly lined with satin pillows, but\ngo ahead and take a load off.
ANA_03_01: Sorry. There's a time limit here,\nand you just hit it. Time's up!
ANA_03_02: I wish you'd hurry up about it.\nYour time's almost up...
ANA_04_01: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\xA04Ah, you're taking a break? Too much\nsuspense for you?\n\n\nWell then, will you take a load off and\nchat with me a bit?[1]OK.[2-]Not now.
ANA_04_02: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x10\x1319Oh...that's too bad. Anyway, once\nyou've rested up, I hope you'll consider\ngiving <b<Thrill Digger >>a try.
ANA_04_03: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0F\x110COh, yes! OK, OK...is there anything\nyou want to ask me?\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\xAFF[1]Who are you?[2]Are you floating?[3]Is it too bright for you?[4-]Nothing.\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x13\x16FF
ANA_04_04: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\xA04My name is <b<Tubert>>! I run this game I\nlike to call <r<Thrill Digger>>! Yep, I'm kind\nof important around here.\n\nYou could even call me <b<Mr. Tubert>>.\nYou know, \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0D\xF01if you want to. Thanks, kid.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\xA09I want everyone to get their claws on\nplenty of Rupees, so I made up this\n<b<Thrill Digger>> thing!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x10\x1319The sad thing is there's been a <r<scary-\nred-monster>> infestation in these parts\nlately, and it's been bad for business.\nAlmost nobody comes to play!\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\xAFFSome days I wish someone would\njust demolish<pling> those ugly <r<towers >>with\na bang and send them scampering\naway.
ANA_04_17: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\xA04My name is <b<Tubert>>! I run this game I\nlike to call <r<Thrill Digger>>! Yep, I'm kind\nof important around here.\n\nYou could even call me <b<Mr. Tubert>>.\nYou know, \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0D\xF01if you want to. Thanks, kid.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\xA09I want everyone to get their hands on\nplenty of Rupees, so I made up this\n<b<Thrill Digger>> thing!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x10\x1319The sad thing is all my <b<Mogma>> friends\nthink Rupees are easy to find. They\nnever come and play...\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\xAFFSo that's why I need you to step up and\nbecome not just a repeat customer,\nbut my only customer!
ANA_04_05: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\xA04My name is <b<Tubert>>! I run this game I\nlike to call <r<Thrill Digger>>! Yep, I'm kind\nof important around here.\n\nYou could even call me <b<Mr. Tubert>>.\nYou know, \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\xB09if you want to. Thanks, kid.
ANA_04_06: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x14\x160AYou mean my glasses? Looking dapper,\neh? The round frames make me\nlook even more fashionable!
ANA_04_13: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x14\xE0BAnd I'm plenty proud of my fine\n<r<mustache>> too! Cute and curly,\nall the way. I groom it every day!\nWait. That rhymed, didn't it?
ANA_04_14: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\xAFFBut it's only to be expected. I can't have\nmy customers upset by my looks!
ANA_04_07: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\xA09No, it's not too bright. I just wear these\nto look cool.
ANA_04_08: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x14\x1605No, I'm not floating. I'm standing on\nmy tail.
ANA_04_15: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\nI don't need to tell you that my <r<paws\n>>are my best feature. 
ANA_04_16: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\xAFFI like to give all my customers a chance\nto admire them. That's why I stand on\nmy tail--it does wonders for sales!
ANA_04_09: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\xA05I'm not floating, no. I just want\ncustomers to see my cute little <r<paws>>,\nso I'm standing on my tail.
ANA_04_10: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x13\x1806So what do you want to ask me next?[1]Who are you?[2]Are you floating?[3]Is it too bright for you?[4-]Nothing.
ANA_04_11: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x10\x1319Really? That's a shame. Well, take\na nice break. <b<Thrill Digger >>is waiting\nfor you whenever you're in the mood\nto poke around for Rupees and bombs!
ANA_04_12: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x10\x1319Really? What a shame...\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0D\x100CBut thanks for asking all those\ngreat questions! Actually, here,\nlet me tell you something.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\xA04You see the shining stone sticking out\nof the wall? That's pure <r<Rupee Ore>>!\nIt's also why there are so many Rupees\nto dig up here.\nIf you sling something at it, it'll <r<pop\n>>right out.<pling> Go on and give it a try!
ANAHINT_01: Thank you very much for your\nparticipation in <r<Thrill Digger>>.\n\n\nHere's a helpful tip: <r<low-value\nRupees >>have only <r<a few bad\nspots >>nearby, so you can relax a\nlittle.\nBut the <r<higher the value of the\n>><r<Rupee>>, the <r<more bad spots >>are\nnearby, so watch it.\nSee you again soon!
