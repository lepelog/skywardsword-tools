DIV_01_05: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0D\x602Heyyyyy, then! Let me tell you all\nabout the rules!\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x12\x600First thing you need to know is you'll be\nshot out of a CANNON! You'll fly\nwaaaaay up there. Don't cry, little\nboy--it's perfectly, mostly safe!\nYour goal is to dive onto a cheery,\ncolorful rotating board. Land on a\nhappy, little colored space, and you'll\nwin Rupees based on the color.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0D\x600BUT! If you land on the gray space--\nI call that the <r<LOSER SPACE>>--then I\nget to reach in and take a handful of\nyour Rupees! Isn't that FUN?!\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x12\x1100You can risk everything to win big here\nat Fun Fun Island, but it's a game of\n<r<luck >>so, uh...don't come crying to me if\nyou land on the <r<loser space>>! HAWHAW!

DIV_01_04: <pause0F>\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x16\xC03You don't have enough Rupees. I can't\nhelp you have FUN if you can't help\nme get rich, little boy!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x600Come back when you've got the 20\nRupees, and we'll try this again!

DIV_11_02: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x10Without it, I can't help make people\nhappy. The smile factory is shut down.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\n\xC00You know...but what can I do?
DIV_11_03: You see, the party wheel that I\npinned to my back flew off the island\nand fell down somewhere below\nthe clouds.\nWithout my party wheel, there's just\nno way I can make this island a place\nwhere people come to have fun!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\n\xC00What can I do?

DIV_11_04: How am I supposed to go get something\nthat fell below the clouds?\nThat's impossible!
DIV_12: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\n\xC10Ugh... It would be so amazing if\nsomeone were to find it. Just think\nof the smiles on the children's faces...\n\nI'm not getting my hopes up, though...
