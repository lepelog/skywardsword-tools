(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN5_65: <0x10009:0x00000017>No matter how much you may miss me,\nI don't make it a habit of having\ncustomers come around my house when\nI'm off the clock, you know?\n<0x10009:0x00010800>Or am I being too self-conscious?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN5_66: <0x10009:0x00000015>Oh, hello! You decided to come see me\nat home...\n\n\nYou're not trying to tell me I'm your\nspecial someone, are you?

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN5_71: <0x10009:0x00080a08>I'm so happy! I feel like I'm in a dream.\nI have to hear it again just to be sure!\n\n\n<0x10009:0x000e1000>Do you really, really, really like me?\n\n\n\n[1-]I do![2-]Uh, sorry...

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN5_78: <0x10009:0x000f120a>No way...\n\n\n\n<0x10009:0x000e1000>You have no feelings for me? All I am\nto you is some girl who stores your\nitems? You really think that?\n[1-]Actually, I like you![2-]Yep.

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN5_74: <0x10009:0x00080a09>...Thank you! I love you so much,\ndarling! I'm sorry I doubted you and\nput you through all that questioning!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN5_83: <0x10009:0x00000013>...But I understand your true feelings.\nBetter than you know.\n\n\nYou're saying that you cannot give\nyourself over to love just yet...\nThat you have much more important\nthings to do right now.\n<0x10009:0x000e1000>You have some kind of serious job you\nhave to attend to first, right?\n\n\n<0x10009:0x000d0f00>If you weren't off on an adventure,\nyou probably wouldn't need to come\nby the Item Check so often.\n\nAnd that's why I won't ask any more of\nyou. I'll just watch over you, protecting\nyou from afar, keeping a vigilant eye\non your items.\n<0x10009:0x000e1000>And when your important work is done,\nwe'll tell my dad we're in love!\n\n\n<0x10009:0x000b0d00>Until then, we'll keep our love secret!\nDarling, I... I'll see you again at the\nItem Check.

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN5_86: <0x10009:0x00000009>I'm glad you told me how you feel,\ndarling. See you soon at the shop!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN5_87: <0x10009:0x00000014>I'm strong. I'll get over you. Please let\nme be alone with the cold night now...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) TOWN5_88: <0x10009:0x0000000d>Darling! I told you that we need to\nkeep our relationship secret! If you\ncome over too often, my dad will\ncatch on to us!\nWhat could you possibly want this late?\n[1-]Need to talk![2-]Nothing.[3-]Deposit items!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN5_89: <0x10009:0x00080008>I'd love to talk forever with you,\nbut my father is staring at us!\nWe can talk another time!

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN5_91: Well, if that's all you wanted, couldn't\nyou have just come to visit me at the\nItem Check during the day?\n\n<0x10009:0x000e1000>Or are you trying to tell me that that's\nall I am to you?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN5_92: <0x10009:0x0000000e>Oh, <heroname>... \nI never knew it would hurt so much...\nto have my heart broken...<0x10009:0x00000014>
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN5_93: <0x10009:0x00000014>I know I said I'd get over it, but...\nSometimes at night, I feel this pain in\nmy chest... I guess that's why they call\nit a broken heart...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) TOWN5_94: <0x10009:0x00000013>I don't know why, but my father\nhas been in a great mood lately...\n\n\nDoes he even realize that his only\ndaughter has just had her heart\nbroken for the very first time?\nHow annoying...
