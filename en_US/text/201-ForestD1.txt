(unk1: 07, unk2: 0) FR_D1_ST_01: Gaze upon your map until your\neye finds the (X), for it is there\nthat you must strike a glittering\ngemstone to reveal a path.\nYou shall find a temple map in\na room with two such gemstones.
(unk1: 07, unk2: 0) FR_D1_ST_02: He who descended from the sky:\nlend your ear to the wise voice\nof the servant who brought you\nto the firm soil.
(unk1: 07, unk2: 0) FR_D1_ST_03: Two doors lead to rooms left and\nright, but they will only open\nwhen the gemstones are struck.\nOne is above, one below.
(unk1: 07, unk2: 0) FR_D1_ST_04: 
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_D1_SW_01: I detect Zelda's aura! There is a high\nprobability that she is beyond this\nlarge door.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_D1_SW_02: 
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_D1_SW_03: The mechanism controlling the lock on\nthis door appears to have been\ndeactivated.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_D1_SW_04: <0x10012:0x0000000b>Master, I have bad news. The auras of\nmany creatures reverberate\nthroughout this temple.\n\nAs a result, I can't isolate Zelda's aura<0x10006:0xfecd>.\n<pause 15>You will <color red<not be able to track her>coloroff> here.\n\n\n<0x10012:0x00000001>Given the situation, I suggest you\n<color green<look around >coloroff>to see where we should\nmove next.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_D1_SW_05: <0x10012:0x00000004>Master <heroname>, I have\ninformation concerning the\nmechanisms that open the doors.\n\nGiven their function, logic dictates\nthat the mechanisms are positioned\nnear the doors that they open.\n\nThere is an 80% probability you will\nlocate these mechanisms if you\nthoroughly explore and <color green<look around\n>coloroff>in every direction.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_D1_SW_06: It appears one of Ghirahim's \nunderlings has reengaged the lock\nhere. You will need to search the\narea for the key once again.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_D1_SW_07: You have acquired a new item.\nAnalysis of this object's insect-like\nprofile and wings indicates <sound 4>it can <color red<fly>coloroff>.\n\nTilt the Wii Remote to <color red<remotely>coloroff> <color red<pilot\n>coloroff>the device. The sharp structure on the\nfront of the device can sever threads\nand deliver a blow to smaller objects.\nTo launch the device, press (B) to\nready it for takeoff then press (A)<0x10011:0x01cd><0x10011:0x05cd>.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_D1_SW_07_02: I will explain about your newly\nacquired <color yellow<<item 75>>coloroff>.\n\n\nUse the Wii Remote to <color red<pilot it remotely>coloroff>.\nThis item's strong jaw can cut thin\nropes or threads and even deliver a\nblow to smaller objects.\nThe jaw power has increased, and it\ncan now carry light objects.\n\n\nFor detailed instructions on using this\nitem, press (B) to ready it for takeoff,\nthen press (2).<0x10011:0x01cd><0x10011:0x05cd>
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_D1_SW_08: I am detecting a greater enemy\npresence in the vicinity than I\npreviously observed. You would be\nwise to proceed with caution.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_D1_SW_08_2: My readings indicate the presence\nof <color yellow<sacred water >coloroff>within the temple.\nUnfortunately, it is<color red< not possible to\nuse your <sound 4>dowsing>coloroff> ability here.\nBased on my calculations, I estimate\nthe water is located in the deepest\npart of the temple complex.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_D1_SW_08_3: I recommend using the (X) on your\nmap as a guide when revisiting the\ndeepest area of the temple.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_D1_SW_09: I detect <color red<sacred water>coloroff> nearby. There\nare no monster auras causing\ninterference, so you can <color red<dowse >coloroff>here.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_D1_SW_10: <0x10012:0x00000004>Master <heroname>, it is likely\nthat I am the servant this tablet is\nreferring to.\n\nTo help you<0x10012:0x00000002> with your mission, the\ngoddess gave me a massive quantity\nof knowledge about this land.\n\nShould you find yourself in need of\nanswers, I hope you won't hesitate to\ncall on me by pressing (v).\n<0x10011:0x09cd>\nIf you <color green<target >coloroff>an object with (Z) and\nthen <color red<press >coloroff>(v), I will tell you all the\ninformation I know about it.<0x10011:0x07cd><0x10011:0x09cd>
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_D1_SW_11: The sentries you see here are born of\nevil magic. They have a tendency to fix\ntheir gaze on any pointed object that\nmoves within their view. 
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_D1_SW_11_2: This set of sentries is bound together.\nThis allows them to resist being rotated\nindependently of one another.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_D1_SW_12: <0x10012:0x00000004>Master, I detect targetable objects in\nyour immediate vicinity.\n\n\nIf you press (v) while <color green<targeting>coloroff> a\nperson or object with (Z), I will provide\nyou with information on that subject.<0x10011:0x07cd><0x10011:0x09cd>
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_D1_SW_13: <0x10012:0x00000004>Master <heroname>, the water\nin this room is...<pause 15><color red<ordinary water>coloroff>.\n\n\nThe <color yellow<sacred water >coloroff>that the Water\nDragon seeks is likely located in \nthe deepest part of the temple.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_01: Just fantastic. I work like a weasel\njust to swipe a key from that monster,\nand then I hafta go and lose it.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_02: I just can't remember which hole\nI hid it in.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_02_2: Eh, what do I need a key for, anyway?\nI can buy a trunk full of those things\nonce I find the treasure I'm after!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_02_3: Aww...and here I thought that key\nwould be my ticket to a life of luxury.<pause 15>\nI could have sworn I <color red<buried it right\naround here>coloroff>...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) FR_D1_MG_03: Hey. What do you want?\n[1-]Key?[2-]Treasure?[3]Never mind.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_03_2: Huh? I can't find it anywhere...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_03_3: It's the darnedest thing. I buried a key\naround here, but I can't recall where\nexactly I put it.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_03_4: You know that big guy? The one who\nlooks like a boulder with legs?\nCraaazy eyebrows too.\n\nSo anyway, he told me about this\n<color red<golden sculpture >coloroff>that opens a\ndoor to some fancy place here.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_03_5: Now where could I have hidden that\nkey? I guess it might not be this room\nafter all. You don't happen to have a\nmap on you, do you, pal?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_03_6: Heyyy, what's with the grin? Ya know\nsomething, don'tcha? Come on.\nSpit it out, kid.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_03_7: Say, that's my missing key! You found\nit and brought it back to me!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_03_8: What?! Ya found my key and then\nused it already?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_03_9: Hmm. I was just thinkin', what use do\nus Mogmas have for keys? We can dig\nour way in and out of anything!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_03_10: Well, good to know where that key\nwent. I gotta get back to hunting for\ntreasure. Here's hoping we both\nstrike it rich in here! See ya!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_04: Hold it... You're that guy. That guy\nI met in the volcano!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_05: Here to do some treasure hunting too?\n[1-]Yep![2-]Nope.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_06: I called it! You got treasure hunter\nwritten all over your face.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_06_2: You're a terrible liar, guy. Ya got\ntreasure hunter written all over\nyour face.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_07: Did the big stone guy out there tip ya\noff to the loot too?\n[1-]Stone guy?[2-]Tip?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_07_2: Yeah, what'd he say again?\n“<sound 4><color green<Strum a chord >coloroff>most beautiful\nin the place within the temple\nwhere the butterflies dance.\"
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_07_3: So I get here, and I let loose with\nsome of the most gorgeous humming\nI've done in my entire life, and\nnothing happens!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_07_4: But seeing how I've come this far,\nthere's no chance I'm gonna give\nup the hunt for treasure just yet!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_08: Sheesh. I dig some serious miles to\nget my paws on treasure, and I've\nfound squat. Talk about bad luck!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_09: I think some no-good thief beat me\nto the goods. There's nuttin' here\nbut <color red<water >coloroff>now.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_10: Who in the stinkin' world would\ncome all this way for water?\nNobody, that's who.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_11: I'm cuttin' my losses and headin' home.\nSee ya!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_12: Whoa there, buddy. I bet you think\nyou're going to run ahead and swipe\nall the best treasure for yourself.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_12_2: But I say you're setting yourself\nup for big-time disappointment.<pause 30>\n\n\nJust 'cause some weird design popped\nup on the wall doesn't mean you're any\ncloser to finding treasure, all right?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_12_3: I think you've been had by that\nboulder with legs!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_12_4: Stay here if ya want. I'm going on\nahead!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_D1_MG_12_5: No one's beatin' me to all the sweet\nloot piled up in this place!

(unk1: 03, unk2: 0) FR_BOSS_03: 
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_BOSSEND_00: Well...<pause 15> You put up more of a fight than\nI would have thought possible out of\nsuch a soft boy.\n\nBut don't clap for yourself quite yet.\n<pause 15>That sword of yours is the only reason\nyou still live.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_BOSSEND_01: I fear I spent far too long teasing and\ntoying with you.\n\n\nThe girl's presence has all but faded\nfrom this place, which means there's\nno reason to linger here.\n\nGood-bye, sky child. Run and play this\ntime. Get in my way again, though,\nand you're dead.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FR_BOSS_BATTLE: <0x10005:0x004b0000>Hah, quite the sword you have here.<pause 15>\nBut so long as <color red<you telegraph your\nattacks >coloroff>like the novice you are,\nyou'll never land a blow.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_BOSS_SW_01: 
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_BOSS_SW_02: <0x10012:0x00000004>Master, as I just translated, it would\nappear that <color blue<Zelda>coloroff> purified herself in\nthe waters of this spring.\n\nI calculate a 97% chance that she has\nalready set out for <color blue<Eldin>coloroff>, where\nanother great spring exists.\n\nHowever, it is not clear what method of\ntravel Zelda used to move from here\nto her next destination.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_BOSS_SW_02_2: My analysis suggests you should take\nthe tablet to the altar in Skyloft.\n\n\nDoing so will likely open a new <sound 4><color red<column\nof light >coloroff>on the surface, allowing you to\ndescend to another area and continue\nyour search for Zelda.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_BOSS_SW_03: Let's return to the sky once more\nbefore continuing our search. The <color blue<bird\nstatue>coloroff> outside can take us back up.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_BOSS_SW_03_2: The bird statue that transports you\nback to the sky should be in the forest\nyou previously passed through.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_WATER_SW_01: There is a 95% probability that the\nwater here is identical to the water\nwithin the Water Dragon's basin.\nI suggest we take it back to her.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) FR_WATER_SW_01_2: My analysis of the water here reveals\nan extraordinarily high concentration\nof energy.\n\nThere is a strong likelihood that this\nenergy will be amplified upon contact\nwith an object of conforming\nwavelength.
