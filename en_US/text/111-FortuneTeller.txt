Everywhere!<pause 20> Yes. <pause 10>Many trees...\nIt would serve you well to buy a <color red<Wooden\nShield >coloroff>before you travel.\n\nI can see that you are a bit young and\ngreen yourself, so it couldn't hurt to\ntake a <color red<Heart Potion >coloroff>with you.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_02: Young man, my visions see...\nFlames! Burning! Smoke! Scorching\nheat! This is in your future...\n\nThe thought of taking a Wooden\nShield to such a place is madness...\nIron! You will need an <color red<Iron Shield >coloroff>to\nprotect yourself!\nAnd you should also take with you some\n<color red<potions to restore your vitality>coloroff>...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_03: I see a place...yes, it's coming into\nfocus now... SAND! Hmm, sand?\nA sandbox? A giant sandbox?\n\nWell, whatever it is, I see it's a desolate\nplace that will cause you troubles with\nelectricity...\n\nIron won't do you any good there. I see\nyou'll need a <color red<Wooden Shield >coloroff>or one\nthat's stronger...\n\nAnd you might find yourself in need of\nbombs there. Make sure to carry\nseveral <color red<Bomb Bags>coloroff>.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_04: The place you are traveling to...\n\n\n\nSomething large awakens?

So where can this tree\ngrow deep and strong?\n<0x10006:0xfccd>I see...<0x10006:0x00cd>a temple! A temple where an\nold woman now lives. Yes, there you\nwill find the perfect place!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_06: Ahhhh, yesss... You are searching\nfor something. Allow me to gaze into\nyour future...\n\nI see...a propeller falling through a\nsea of clouds...

What you seek is <color red<just down\nthe mountain from this temple>coloroff>...\nA burning mountain... Could such a\nthing truly exist?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_07: Ahh... Structures with large, whirling\nsails come into focus. Something\ncreates a gust, and the structures...\nturn! The two buildings face...a tower!

(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_09: Young man, I see visions of the path\nthat lies before you. You will face a\ntrial! Yesss...deep within the shadows.\nA hair-raising test...\nGo to the woods! There you will find\nthe test that awaits you!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_09_1: Oh! I see that you've safely cleared the\ntrial in the woods. Yessss...you can hide\nnothing from these eyes!\n\nMy visions...they show me a<color red< large tree\n>coloroff>in the middle of that forest.

Oh, yes, I see a flurry of\nactivity in your future.\nAnyway, just get yourself to the place\nwith many trees!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_27: My big, crystal-clear eyes...they see\na path before you! You must learn a\n<color red<song >coloroff>within a holy sanctum!\n\nAnd what's this? My vision shows me\nit is a place you've visited before.\nA sacred place among the clouds...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_10: What's next for you? Let's see what\nwe can see... You will find <color red<the entrance\nto a trial >coloroff>lying hidden in a sandy place!\n\nThat is all the vision shows. These\neyes, they have seen much. Your next\ndestination is a place awash in sand.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_10_1: Oho! You appear to have passed a\ngreat trial in a sandy place. No time\nfor congratulations--more visions\napproach!\nHmm... You must go to a place with\neven MORE sand. But I also see\n<color red<an expanse of water>coloroff>...<pause 20> And a <color red<ship>coloroff>!<pause 20>\nThis is all very confusing to behold...\nAnyway, you need to get to another\nsandy place!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_11: Sheesh! How many of these trials\nmust you undergo before your hunger\nfor challenge will be sated?!\n\nThis time I see...fire! You will find\n<color red<the entrance to a trial>coloroff> lying hidden on\na fiery mountain!\n\nAnd of course you would not think to\ntake a <color red<Wooden Shield>coloroff>, because that\nwould be foolish!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_14: Ahhh, I see you passed the trial of fire\nwith ease. But you have jumped from\nthe frying pan into...troubled water!\nOh dear... I mean, water troubles!\nOoooh, yess... I see that lack of water\nwill cause you much hardship. When\nthis happens, return and visit me\nonce more.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_15: Water, water nowhere...and so great\nthe need! Such a thirst to quench!\nThis is a vexing circumstance indeed. \n\nBut, young man, you have already\ndiscovered the basin needed in order\nto carry the water.\n\nYes, yes...it's all clear to me now.\nNever forget...these eyes see ALL!\nGo to the woods, for it is there that\nyou will find what you seek.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_28: I see a vision, yesss... I see you at a\nmountain of fire, guiding a basin of\nwater.\n\nAnd...ah, yes! Failure to deliver it will\nspell trouble for a certain someone!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_26: Aha! The task before you is as clear as\nmy unblinking eyes, young man!\n\n\nIt is also as hot as ever within the\nmountain of fire. To go there with\nan <color red<Iron Shield>coloroff> would be most wise!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_12: Gulp... Again I see the shadow of a\ntowering monster...\n\n\nMy boy...no matter how many times I\npeer into your future, it never provides\na dull moment!\n\nOh, do forgive me... I didn't mean to\nimply your fate was entertaining, even\nif it is... Just take plenty of <color red<potions>coloroff>.\nThe fortunes tell me you'll be fine!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_13: Young man, whatever have you done?\n\n\n\nIf my eyes do not betray me, then you\nare the one behind the disappearance\nof the Isle of the Goddess! Yess...\nNothing escapes my gaze.\nWell, worry not. I can see that you did\nnot make the isle disappear just for\nidle amusement!\n\nStill, I am afraid that it will be up to\nyou to find the proper path from here.\nTrust yourself!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_17: I see you've finally found the one\nyou've been searching for! That is\nwonderful news.\n\nHowever, your trials are not yet ended!\nNow you must speak to the great giant\nwho swims above the clouds.\n\nIf you wish to know more, you should\ntalk to the <color red<headmaster of the Knight\nAcademy>coloroff>.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_16: Young man, you seek a song that has\nbeen divided into four parts, do you\nnot? Yes, yessss...I see all.\n\nThen there are one...two...<pause 10>three\nregions that you must visit! And you\nmay go to them in the order of your\nchoosing!\nIn other words, go wherever you want,\nOK? You're bound to find something.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_29: Oh, there it is! Yesss, I see you have\ngathered three parts of the song you\nseek, and the fourth... It is held by\nsomeone very, very big!\nMake haste, for when you find this\nmassive creature, your song will be\ncomplete. I have foreseen it!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_18: You will use the song you obtained\nfrom the great swimmer above the\nclouds to discover <color red<the location of the\nnext trial>coloroff>.\nMy vision shows me that this next trial\nawaits you <color red<somewhere in this very town\nof Skyloft>coloroff>.\n\nStrange... I have no idea what that\neven means!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_22: So I see you have finally passed the\nfinal trial... Oh, yessss, all is revealed\nto my uncanny vision.\n\nI can see what you're after. You want\nto know what to do with the item you\ngot from the trial, don't you? \n\nSomewhere here in Skyloft is a <color red<statue\nof an odd bird >coloroff>with <color red<gem-like eyes>coloroff>.\nOh, but one of the gems is missing.\nSurely you've seen it before...\nAhem... If you place the item you have\nin the socket, your path will be clear!\nYessss...I see it all now...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_23: Ah, yesss... My vision reveals that you\nwill find what you seek on the Isle of\nthe Goddess.\n\nHowever, these great big eyes also see\nmuch peril. Your path will not be an\neasy one. Prepare yourself well!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_19: Also, if you happen to be looking for a\n<color red<plant>coloroff> of some kind, then I also saw\na great green <color red<forest>coloroff>. <0x10006:0xfbcd>Hmm... I can\nhardly imagine such a place...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_20: Also...you are searching for someone\nto plow a field for you, are you not?\n\n\nYou will find no such person in Skyloft!\nInstead, you must go to the <color red<caves>coloroff> where\n<color red<those who are skilled at digging>coloroff> dwell!\n\nThere you will find the right person for\nthe job. I have foreseen it!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_21: Ah! Yes, yes! I see it! You are searching\nfor something lost. A shiny, whirling\nthing...\n\nI see <color red<a dry place with sand>coloroff>! You will\nfind it there in a place that is, itself,\nnot easy to find. These big, dewy\neyes...they do not lie!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) FTEL_50_24: Oh! The mists are parting... I also see a\nperson who has lost a rare bug...\n\n\nMy crystal ball reveals that this bug \nis being held in secret on an island\nby <color red<one with a love for insects>coloroff>!
