TROLLEY_01_01: This station here was used by\nfolks heading into the old mines.\nPeople still ride the mine carts\nall over the place, though!\nI am probably supposed to tell you\nthere is some \x201Csafety information\"\nabout using the carts posted on\nthe wall over there.\nCart riding can be, uh...dangerous at\ntimes, so I would suggest you give that\nstuff a quick read.
TROLLEY_01_02: It is pretty fun to ride these mine carts.\nOne day, I would love to set up a race!
TROLLEY_01_03: Up for another run on the Rickety\nCoaster? You never know what will\nhappen. Just 20 Rupees!\n[1]Sure![2-]Uh...no.
TROLLEY_01_04: Hey, Link! You are back!\n\n\n\nThink you have got the stomach to ride\nthe Rickety Coaster? Just 20 Rupees!\n[1]I'm in![2-]No, thanks.
TROLLEY_01_05: Oh well. Maybe some other time, eh?
TROLLEY_01_06: You are out of cash? Well, then I guess\nthat is that. Come back once you get\nyourself some pocket change.
TROLLEY_01_07: Want to hear the rules again?\n[1]Sure.[2-]Nope.
TROLLEY_01_08: This here is a race against time--\nscream across that finish line as fast\nas you can!\n\nTilt the Wii Remote to lean your cart.\nIf you lean at just the right angle on a\ncorner, you will get a nice speed boost.\n\nLose your concentration when you are\ncruising around a bend, though, and\nyou will run right off the rails. If that\nhappens, you lose the race.
TROLLEY_01_09: Your best time so far is:\n<numeric arg0>:<numeric arg1(2)>:<numeric arg2(2)>.
TROLLEY_01_10: All right, let us get going!
TROLLEY_01_11: So I have your attention?\n[1]Yes.[2-]No.
TROLLEY_01_12: Hey, you! What are you doing?\n\n\n\nWell, you are here now...so how about a\nlittle fun?\n[1]Fun?[2-]No way.
TROLLEY_01_13: Now, come on, do not be like that.\nHear me out first!\n[1]OK.[2-]No chance.
TROLLEY_01_14: Got your attention, eh? Geheh.\nLet me explain...
TROLLEY_01_15: You could at least let me explain\nthe rules...
TROLLEY_01_16: Oh, all right, see you some other time!
TROLLEY_01_17: What about all these prizes I have?\nSo you are OK with letting them go to\nwaste? You really are not interested?\n[1]Let's do it.[2-]I'm sure.
TROLLEY_01_18: Well, come back anytime you want to\ngive it a try!
TROLLEY_01_19: You finished!
TROLLEY_01_20: You set a new record!\nGreat work!
TROLLEY_01_21: Hope you come by again soon!
TROLLEY_01_22: Hold it. You cannot be serious. \nThat was way too slow! Look, there is \njust no way I can give you a prize for\nthat time.
TROLLEY_01_23: I know you can do better than that.\nYou were just warming up, right?\n\n\nThe secret is in getting just the right\ntilt. Here--you have earned this prize\nat least.
TROLLEY_01_24: Not a bad time. Nope, not bad at all!\nHere is your prize!
TROLLEY_01_25: Whoa, now! That was...unbelievable!\nEven I cannot go that fast.
TROLLEY_01_26: What do you say? Have you got the guts\nto ride the Rickety Coaster? Just 20\nRupees a ride.\n[1]Sure![2-]No, thanks.
TROLLEY_01_27: So what track will it be?\n[1]Scary![2]Heart stopping!
TROLLEY_01_28: Got it--the scary track it is. Good luck!
TROLLEY_01_29: So you want the heart-stopping track,\neh? You got it, but I just hope you are\nready...
TROLLEY_01_30: Your best time so far is:\n<numeric arg3>:\x0E\x02\x03\x06\x00\x04\x2CD:\x0E\x02\x03\x06\x00\x05\x2CD.
TROLLEY_01_31: Time is up. Try again next time!
TROLLEY_01_32: Here you go! I found this treasure\nright here on this very island.
TROLLEY_01_33: This is something I have been saving\njust for you.
TROLLEY_01_34: You get a Rupee I have taken really\ngood care of! I have been holding on to\nthis one forever, but it is yours now.
TROLLEY_01_35: Not a bad time, but you are nowhere\nnear as fast as I am. Here are\n50 Rupees!
TROLLEY_02_01: Hey, that is my seat! Nobody sits their\nrear end on my seat but me, got it?
TROLLEY_02_02: I have been here alone for...well, who\nknows how long. Years.\n\n\nBut I get to ride these carts every\nday, and I never get bored of it!
TROLLEY_03_01: I am here every day running this\ncoaster, but you are the only one who\never shows up. Could you spread the\nword? It is lonely out here. And...dry.
