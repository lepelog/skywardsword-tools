CFB_01: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01...At last. I've been expecting you,\nLink.\n\n\nYou are doubtless overwhelmed, so I\nwill explain things as simply as I can.
CFB_02: This is the<r< Temple of Hylia>>, though it \nwill come to be known as the <b<Sealed\nTemple>> sometime in the future.\n\nYou stand in the past, ages before your\nown time. Here the goddess Hylia\nhas only just sealed away <b<Demise>>...\n\nAnd little time has passed since the\ngoddess sent the outcropping of rock\ninto the sky that would one day\nbecome Skyloft.
CFB_03: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\xF0F\x703It is true to its name. You have passed\nthrough the Gate of Time to an era\nin the distant past.\n\nYou will have many questions. But for\nnow, you must proceed back through\nthe great doors behind you.
CFB_04: It is there that the person you've risked\nlife and blood to defend waits for you.
CFB_05: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x03You stand in the past, ages before your\nplace in time. Here, the goddess Hylia\nhas only just sealed away <b<Demise>>...\n\nYou will have many questions. But for\nnow, you must proceed through the\ngreat doors at the back of the room.\n\nIt is there that the person you've risked\nlife and blood to defend waits for you.\n
CFB_18: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x03I see you've said good-bye.\n\n\n\nNow you must keep the promise you\nmade to her. You must find the\n<y+<Triforce>>.\n\nReturn to your time. There is work to\nbe done there.
CFB_19: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\nDo not fear for <b<Zelda>>. I will watch\nover her here. Go now and fulfill\nyour destiny.
CFB_25: <pause0F>.<pause0F>.<pause0F>.\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0F\x803Hmm...\n\n\n[1]What's up?[2]See you later.
CFB_26: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x703Oh, it's a matter of no great concern...
CFB_27: Hmm...
CFB_28: Do you see that sunny patch of earth\nover there?\n\n\nI thought it might be nice to plant a\ntree of some sort there.\n\n\nI imagine it would please <b<Zelda>> greatly\nto see a great tree welcoming her\nback when she wakes from her slumber.
CFB_29: Sadly, it's a rare tree that grows strong\nfor thousands of years on end. If only\nI could find the <r<seedling>> of such a\nhearty specimen...
CFB_30: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x03A tree that grows strong for thousands\nof years... If only I could find the\n<r<seedling>> of such a tree...
CFB_31: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x0BAh, you've planted a seedling!\n\n\n\nI sense great vitality in this sprout.\nWith any luck, it shall grow into a stout\ntree that will live on for millennia.
CFB_31_01: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x03I sense great vitality in this sprout.\nWith any luck, it shall grow into a stout\ntree that will live on for millennia.
CFB_32: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01You've yet to complete the great \nmission entrusted to you.\n\n\nFor Zelda, who still waits in everlasting\nslumber, you must fulfill the destiny\nthat is only yours to complete.
CFB_33: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x12Urgh... <pause0A>Link...?\nIt's Ghirahim...<pause0A> He appeared out of\nthin air and got the drop on me.\n\nDon't worry about me... You must\nchase after him!
CFB_33_01: He ran through the <r<great doors >><r<at the\nfront of the temple>>. You may yet catch\nhim before it's too late. Hurry!
CFB_33_02: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x12<b<Ghirahim >>ran through the <r<great doors\nat the front of the temple>>. If you hurry,\nyou may yet stop him!
CFB_34: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\xC0BDo not panic. <b<Zelda >>is fine. She rests in\nthe back room of the temple.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0F\x700I never expected Demise would rise\nagain. <pause0A>It seems now that the fate of the\nworld rests solely in your hands,\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x706Link!
CFB_35: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\xC04Do not panic. <b<Zelda >>is fine. She rests\nin the back room of the temple.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x706Focus on the battle at hand. Defeat\nDemise and save our world,\nLink.
CFB_BAD_01: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0E\x20DPhew! That was WAY too close back\nthere. I got a serious sweat going!\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x200Can you imagine what would've\nhappened if I hadn't pulled off one of\nmy famous Groose maneuvers to\ncatch <b<Zelda>>?\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x200I'll stay here and make sure she's\nprotected, so don't worry about her\none bit. Just get out there and clobber\nthat Demise creep!\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x203I'm counting on you, Link!\nWe all are!
CFB_BAD_02: You gotta get out there and whale on\nDemise until he cries like a creepy\nlittle baby!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x03I'm counting on you, Link!\nWe all are!
CFB_SWORD_00: \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster Link, I have\nimportant information for you.\n\n\nOnce you enter this portal, my analysis\nindicates a 0% chance that you will be\nable to return, unless you are able\nto vanquish your foe.\nAre you ready to proceed?\n[1]I'm ready![2-]Not yet...

CFB_SWORD_03: \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x04Master Link, do you wish\nto retreat temporarily in order to\nresupply yourself for the final battle?\n[1]Yes![2-]I'm fine.
