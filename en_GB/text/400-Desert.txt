DS_ROBO_D_02: Where did you come from, dzzzzt?\nWe're here collecting Timeshift Stones\nand transporting them to <b<Lanayru\nMining Facility>>.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1303\x00Stay away from the blue stones, zrrpt.\nThey're too dangerous for humans!
DS_ROBO_D_02_a: Stay away from the blue stones, zrrpt.\nThey're too dangerous, vrrrrrm, for\nhumans! And try not to get in the way!
DS_ROBO_E_01: ...
DS_ROBO_E_02: That's a mine cart for transporting\nTimeshift Stones, zrrpt. They're not\nfor human use, so get lost, vrrm!
DS_ROBO_F_01: ...
DS_ROBO_F_02: Do not interfere with mining\noperations! Stop talking to me, zrrpt!
DS_ROBO_G_01: ...
DS_ROBO_G_02: The mine cart in front of the door is\ngoing to pass through here, so it's\ndangerous for you to be there, vrrm!\nMaybe you should just go away, zrrpt!
DS_ROBO_H_01: ...
DS_ROBO_H_02: Help, zrrt!
DS_ROBO_H_02_a: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1303\x00If you hadn't come along, they would\nhave sucked all of the electricity out\nof me, vrrm!\n\nOh...<pause1E> Look at that, zrrpt... You have a\n<y+<<item35>>>. It appears to be an older model\nof Lanayru fabrication.\n\nAs thanks for saving me, I will <r<upgrade>>\n<r<it>> for you, zwooop. \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1303\x00Give it here for a\nsecond, phwing!
DS_ROBO_H_02_b: I've added a <r<pincer modification so\nyou can grab things>>, brrrrrrrt.\nBe careful out there, zrrt!
DS_ROBO_H_02_c: Still hanging around here?\nBe careful, vrrm!
DS_ROBO_H_02_d: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1303\x00Thank you, zrrt!
DS_ROBO_I_01: ...
DS_ROBO_I_02: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x03\x900This is the <b<Temple of Time>>. Within it\nis the sacred <b<Gate of Time >>made by the\ngoddess, bzzt.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x03\x900It's my job to patrol outside the temple,\nvrrm! If you want to reach the Gate of\nTime, you will need to pass through\nthat door, bzzap.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x03\x900Huh? You need another way in,\nphoo-weep?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x03\x900Well, <b<Lanayru Mining Facility >>and the\n<b<Temple of Time >><r<are connected\nunderground>>, dzzt. Lanayru Mining\nFacility is right here!
DS_ROBO_I_02_a: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x03\x900Lanayru Mining Facility is just ahead.\nGood luck, vrrt!
DS_ROBO_I_02_b: No matter how many times I see the\nTemple of Time, my circuits still get\noverloaded with impressiveness, zrrp!
DS_ROBO_I_02_c: Help, zrrt!
DS_ROBO_I_02_d: That was scary, vrrrrrm...\nThanks for helping me, bzzt.
DS_ROBO_I_02_e: This map... It looks inaccurate, bzzt.\nI'm going to fix it for you, zrrm!
DS_ROBO_J_01: ...
DS_ROBO_J_02: You are not in my memory banks, brrt.\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1303\x00This is the power generator for the\nmechanism that opens the entrance\nto Lanayru Mining Facility, zrrpt!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1303\x00But it won't budge until you activate\nthe remote power nodes and set those\n<r<three dials>> to access them correctly.
DS_ROBO_J_02_a: Did you figure out how to access the\nremote power nodes, zrrpt? Just\nsetting the dials will not be enough to\nopen the entrance to the facility, vrrm.
DS_ROBO_J_02_b: Did you figure out how to access the\nremote power nodes, zrrbt? That is\nmost impressive...for a human, vrrm.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1303\x00This is <b<Lanayru Mining Facility>>,\nphwing! It is where Timeshift Stones\nare produced.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1303\x00No matter how many times I see this\nplace, my rotors still hum with\nadmiration, bzzt!
DS_ROBO_J_02_c: This is <b<Lanayru Mining Facility>>,\nphwing! It is where Timeshift Stones\nare produced.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1303\x00No matter how many times I see this\nplace, my rotors still hum with\nadmiration, bzzt!
DS_ROBO_K_01: ...
DS_ROBO_K_02: You're trying to figure out how to\nconfigure the device to get you into\nLanayru Mining Facility, zrrpt?\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1303\x00You look kind of suspicious, vrrm.\nI probably shouldn't be telling you how\nto access the remote power nodes to\nenter the facility, zwoop.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1303\x00And don't let me catch you stabbing\nor fiddling with this device, bzzt!
DS_ROBO_K_03: Ahhh! What are you doing, vrrt?!\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1303\x00Still... You'll never get it to open just\nfiddling with the dials, bzzt.
DS_ROBO_K_04: You look kind of suspicious, vrrm.\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1303\x00Don't let me catch you fiddling with\nthis device, bzzt!

DS_ROBO_N_01: ...
DS_ROBO_N_02: Huh? You're looking for work, zrrpt?\nThen get rid of that funny-looking hat\nand come back with a helmet, vrrm!
DS_ROBO_O_01: ...
DS_ROBO_O_02: These strange things have started\nattacking us recently, vrrm. We don't\nhave any weapons to defend ourselves,\nso if they attack, we're fried, phweep!
DS_ROBO_P_01: ...
DS_ROBO_P_02: You're interested in the Timeshift\nStones? Then you should take a tour\nof <b<Lanayru Mining Facility>>, zooop!
DS_ROBO_Q_01: ...
DS_ROBO_Q_02: The Timeshift Stones power us, as\nwell as the machines we use, vreep!\nThat's why we have to stay hard at\nwork, zoop!
DS_ROBO_R_01: ...
DS_ROBO_R_02: I don't see many humans around here,\nvrrt. Are you interested in the\nTimeshift Stones, phweep?
DS_ROBO_S_01: ...
DS_ROBO_S_02: My friend was kidnapped the other\nday, vrrt! And I heard they sucked out\nall of his electricity, zrrrrpt!
DS_ROBO_F3: You are looking for the dragon god,\nzrrpt?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1303\x00If it's <b<Master Thunder Dragon >>you \nwant to meet, he's to the south of\n<b<Lanayru Caves>>, bzzt. I don't know of\nany other dragons, though, phweep.
DS_SWORD_01_a: \x0E\x01\x05\x04Z\x00\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BA report, Master Link.\nWe have arrived at <b<Lanayru Mine>>.
DS_SWORD_01_b: \x0E\x01\x05\x04Z\x00This arid region was transformed into\na desert over the course of several\nhundred years.
DS_SWORD_01_c: \x0E\x01\x05\x04Z\x00My projections show that <b<Zelda>> must\nhave traveled through this area.
DS_SWORD_02: My estimates indicate that this object\nhas been broken for many years.\nI am unable to analyze the content of\nits speech at this time.
DS_SWORD_02_a: I am able to confirm that a time-shift\nhas occurred within this space.\n\n\nAny impact to the blue stones creates a\nsustained temporal disruption field in\nthe surrounding area. Readings show\nthat this area <r<<pling>is in a past time-state>>.
DS_SWORD_03: 
DS_SWORD_04: Readings indicate the materials used \nto construct the <b<generator>> are also \npresent in this area. You can now use \nyour <pling><r<dowsing>> ability to locate them.
DS_SWORD_05: A report, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master. I can no longer\ndetect <b<Zelda>>'s aura.
DS_SWORD_05_2: The moment the gate was destroyed,\nZelda's presence disappeared from my\nreadings. <pling><r<You can no longer search for\nher with your dowsing ability>>.
DS_SWORD_05_3: Zelda's companion instructed you to\nmeet with the ancient one in the Sealed\nGrounds.\n\nThis corresponds with the records in\nmy memory. I propose that we travel to\nthe <b<Sealed Temple>>.
DS_SWORD_06_a: <b<\x0E\x01\x05\x04Z\x00>>We have arrived at <b<Lanayru Deser>><b<t>>.\nThe terrain in this area changed\ndramatically as climate forces rapidly\nturned it into a desert.
DS_SWORD_06_b: \x0E\x01\x05\x04Z\x00I have confirmed numerous areas of\n<r<sinksand>>. Should you step in sinksand,\nyou may be swallowed by the desert.\nBodily danger has increased by 30%.
DS_SWORD_06_c: \x0E\x01\x05\x04Z\x00As a safety measure, I recommend\nyou <r<<pling>check the terrain>> on your map\nwith \x0E\x02\x04\x02\x3CD. \x0E\x01\x11\x02\x3CD
DS_SWORD_06_d: \x0E\x01\x05\x04Z\x00My readings indicate that <b<Zelda >>has\npassed through here. As previously\nstated, this area is highly dangerous.\n\n<b<\x0E\x01\x05\x04Z\x00>>I suggest reuniting with her quickly\nto determine the motivations behind\nher actions at <b<Eldin>> <b<Province>>.
DS_SWORD_07: 
DS_SWORD_09: 
DS_SWORD_09_2: 
DS_SWORD_08: \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BA report, Master Link.\n\n\n\nThe map you possess corresponds to the\nactual terrain of this area with only\n35% accuracy.\n\nThe robot you met earlier modified\nyour map to show <r<past terrain>><pling> that is\nnow submerged below the sinksand.
DS_SWORD_08_2: \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster Link, I have\ninformation to report.\n\n\nI can confirm that you will not be\nconsumed by the sinksand in this\ncurrent position. I suggest verifying\nyour location on the map.
DS_SWORD_08_3: Readings indicate that there is a\nsubmerged path beneath the\nsinksand.\n\nIt is possible to walk along a route\nabove this path without submerging\ncompletely into the sinksand.\n\nSimulations suggest that placing\nbeacons to mark a safe route along\nthese paths before proceeding would\nsignificantly reduce risk.
DS_SWORD_08_4: I recommend placing <b<multiple>><pling> beacons.
DS_SWORD_10: We have arrived at <b<Lanayru Mine>>.\n\n\n\nYou can use your dowsing ability to\nlocate the entrance to the trial you\nmust pass to open the way to the\nsacred flame.
DS_SWORD_11: We have arrived at <b<Lanayru Desert>>.\n\n\n\nYou can use your dowsing ability to\nlocate the entrance to the trial you\nmust pass to open the way to the \nsacred flame.
DS_SWORD_12: We have arrived at the <b<Temple of Time>>.\n\n\n\nYou can use your dowsing ability to\nlocate the entrance to the trial you\nmust pass to open the way to the\nsacred flame.
DS_SWORD_13: Congratulations, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x04Master.
DS_SWORD_14: \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01You have completed the trial. You now\nhave the power to proceed to the sacred\nflame that will be entrusted to your\nsword and your strong spirit.
DS_SWORD_15: The <y<<item14> >>are one of the goddess's\nsacred gifts.\n\n\nYou can extend these claws attached to\nchains to pull yourself to <r<targets >>and\n<r<vines>> beyond your reach.
DS_SWORD_16: The flame is somewhere in the desert...\nI conjecture that it lies in a place\nyou have not yet visited, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master.
DS_SWORD_17: A report, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster Link.
DS_SWORD_17_2: The symbols on this power generator\ncorrespond to the symbols on the three\nremote power nodes you activated.\nLogic suggests that they are connected.
DS_SWORD_18: \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster Link, all three\nremote power nodes have been\nactivated.\n\nPlease make your way to the <r<power\ngenerator >>in front of <b<Lanayru\nMining Facility>>.
DS_SWORD_19: A report, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster Link.\nMy analysis indicates that you can\nrestore this <r<device>> to an operable state\nby inserting a source of energy.
DS_SWORD_20: <b<Tumbleweeds>> sometimes roll across the\nsand in Lanayru Desert and other\nplaces.\n\nTumbleweeds are used as a material to \nupgrade a variety of items. You can\ncollect them with a<r< Bug Net>>.
DS_GORO_D_01: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2F08\xD02Hello, hello, Link.
DS_GORO_D_02: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\xD00I just remembered, Link.\nI have got something to report on the\nexcavation project you invested in\nearlier!<pause14>\nI found loads of Timeshift Stones!\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2F00\xD01Now I can pay you back 10 times what\nyou gave me!
DS_GORO_D_03: How is your search for that <b<sacred\nflame >>going? Did you find it?!\n\n\nI have been dying to hear whether you\nfound it. Well...did you?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2F08\x407.<pause14>.<pause14>.<pause14>So after that wild, long adventure,\nyou found it! \x0E\x03\x01\x00Link, you\nare truly amazing.
DS_GORO_D_03_2: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2F08\xD0AYou know, I think it is time I tell you\nwhat I found out about the legend of\nthe three dragons.<pause0F>\n\nI am certain there is a hidden area just\nbeyond here in the desert!\n\n\nYou see, I found a <r<narrow passageway>><pling>\nthat was too tight for me to fit through.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2F00\xD00And my gut tells me that one of the\nthree dragons of legend, the <r<Thunder\nDragon>>, lives there!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2F00\x800These robots are connected to him\nsomehow. I am sure of it, bud.<pause0F>\n\n\n<r<\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2F01\x807\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDThe T>><r<hunder Dragon>>, robots, and\nTimeshift Stones<pause14>.<pause14>.<pause14>.<pause14>\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2F08\x708\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x2CD\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x2CDWhat an adventure!
DS_GORO_D_04: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2F08\xD0AI found the passage that leads\nto where the <r<Thunder Dragon>> lives...<pause2D>\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCD\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2F0D\x800But it is too narrow for a big guy like\nme to pass through. \x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCD\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2F08\x700If only there was a\nway...
DS_GORO_D_05: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2F0C\xD01\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCD\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x1CD\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2F00\x01Hey, you over there! Say, is that\nmy buddy Link?\nIt is!\n\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCD\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x1CDYou have come at the perfect\ntime! <pause0F>I have something I want to\nshow you.<pause0F>\n\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\x2CD\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x1CDCome on up here!
DS_GORO_D_06: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2F08\x709\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link! You made it into the\ndragon's territory?!<pause54>\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2F01\x805\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x2CDI am so jealous!<pause5A>\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2F0F\x706\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x2CDYou outdid me again, bud!
DS_GORON_A_01: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02Good to see you, bud! Seems like you\npop up everywhere! Though I am one\nto talk...\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x17\x2008Anyway, bud, there is something I am\ndying to tell you. It is the discovery of\nthe century!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x2000This is a sacred place known as the\n<b<Temple of Time>>.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x190AI could not believe my eyes when I saw a\n<r<human who lives on the legendary\nIsle of the Goddess>>!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x1900It wore clothes just like the ones\nwritten about in the ancient\nmanuscripts! And it looked just\nlike you, bud!\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\x2105It came with another person...and they\nentered the temple! I wanted to chase\nafter them...\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x1B00But then there was an explosion all of a\nsudden! And the entrance... Well, you\ncan see for yourself, bud.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x16\x2007I do not think we are getting past this\nmess. I just wish we could find out\nwhat is happening on the other side!
DS_GORON_A_02: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x1B09What? You made it inside?\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x1B00You mean to say there is a secret\npassage I did not know about?\nWhy did you not tell me, bud?!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\x2100I was just about to give up and go home\nwhen I heard this huge crash. I rushed\nback to find that the way had been\ncleared.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x16\x2007I am going to explore inside. \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x2000I have to\ngo back to the Sealed Grounds soon, \nso it looks like I am going to be busy!
DS_GORON_A_03: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x16\x2007I wish I could see what is happening\non the other side! Maybe there is\nanother way into the temple?
DS_GORON_A_04: \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x16\x2007I am going to explore inside! \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x2000I have to\nhead back to the Sealed Grounds soon,\nso it looks like I am going to be busy.
