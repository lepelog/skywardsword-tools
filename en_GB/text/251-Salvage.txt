(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) F_SAL_01: I can verify with only 40% accuracy\nthat this person is a plant. However,\n<color blue<Owlan>coloroff>'s field of study includes\ncataloging unidentified plant species.\nWe can take this creature to Skyloft\nusing the robot. Would you like to call\nthe robot?\n[1-]Please![2]No, thanks.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) F_SAL_01_01: Yes, <0x10012:0x00000005>Master. Simply inspect\nthe specimen again if you change your\nmind and wish to take it to Skyloft.
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) F_SAL_01_02: Yes, <0x10012:0x00000005>Master. I will signal the robot\nwith a telepathic transmission.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) F_SAL_02: <0x10012:0x00000064>Mistress Fi! I hope you weren't\nwaiting long, bzzzzat! So you want me\nto carry this, zrrbt?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) F_SAL_03: I'll be waiting for you up in the sky,\nso don't take too long, vrrrt!
(unk1: 02, unk2: 0) F_SAL_04: <0x10012:0x00000001>Master, I suggest we also return to\nthe sky and carry the Kikwi to its\ndestination quickly.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) F_SAL_05: <0x10012:0x00000064>Move it! Move it! Zrrppt! Forcing me to\ntell you this every time reduces my\noverall efficiency, brrzt!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) F_SAL_MORY01: <0x10009:0x00000001>Oh, hello again, kweek! I've been\nhiding out so long my shoulders are\nstiff.\n[1-]What shoulders?[2-]Poor thing.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) F_SAL_MORY02: <0x10009:0x00090014>How rude! I do have shoulders,\nkweek--they're just not very\npronounced!\n\n<0x10009:0x00070011>All I was trying to say is that constantly\nhiding from danger is a stressful way to\nlive, koo-keek!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) F_SAL_MORY06: <0x10009:0x00070011>That's right, kwee! Sitting in one spot\nall the time, never knowing when\ndanger is going to come along...kook.\nYou can't know what that's like!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) F_SAL_MORY03: <0x10009:0x00090013>I bet there are still tons of horrible\nmonsters out there waiting to scratch\nme and do mean things, koo-weep!\n\n<0x10009:0x00070004>We Kikwis have to spend our entire\nlives hiding like this just to survive,\nkwee-koo!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) F_SAL_MORY03_2: <0x10009:0x00090013>Everyone seems happy that peace\nhas returned to the forest... But I don't\nbelieve it for a second, koo-kakoo!\n\n<0x10009:0x00070004>There's no way I'm going to give up\nand come out of hiding. Not ever,\nkee-woop!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) F_SAL_MORY04: <0x10009:0x00090005>But sometimes I wonder, keep-eep...\nIsn't there somewhere peaceful I can\nlive without fear, without having to\nhide?\n[1-]There is![2-]I can help.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) F_SAL_MORY05: <0x10009:0x00060007>Oh! That's fantastic news, koo-karoo!\nI want you to take me there as soon as\nyou can!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) F_SAL_MORY07: <0x10009:0x00070014>You've got some nerve, ko-ko-ko!\nHow dare you promise to take me to\nthe skies, kee-roo, and then suddenly\nchange your mind!\n<0x10009:0x00090013>I was so sad thinking I would never get\nto settle down somewhere safe,\nkee-reep!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) F_SAL_MORY08: <0x10009:0x00070004>So! Take me with you this time, ka-koo!\n\n\n\n<0x10009:0x00000001>Kee-karoo! Don't let me down!
