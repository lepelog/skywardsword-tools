(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) AKUM_21: <0x10009:0x00000005>Isn't that a fun game...? Oh, dear...\nPerhaps an explanation is in order! \n\n\nMy name is <color blue<Batreaux>coloroff>, and I am a\nmonster who resides here in this\nhumble dwelling below Skyloft.\n\nBut please allow me to correct one\npopular misconception. While I'm\ncertainly a monster, I wouldn't dream\nof terrorizing the people of this town!\nYou see, this adorable little girl is the\nonly one who didn't let loose a blood-\ncurdling scream at the sight of me!\n\nSince she began to visit me here, I've\nfelt positively jubilant! You see, my\nheart's only wish is to become friends\nwith the lovely people of Skyloft.\nBut as you can surely imagine, it has\nproven quite difficult to break the ice\nwhen they are struck with paralyzing\nfear at the mere sight of me!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) AKUM_22: I assure you, nothing would fill my\nheart with joy more than to be friends\nwith the fine people of this town.\n\nBut as soon as I try to approach any of\nthem and extend my claw in friendship,\nthey run and scream as though they've\nseen a walking nightmare!\nOh, right... Silly me. I've gotten ahead\nof myself! You see, there is an old tale\namong my monstrous kin that goes\nas follows...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) AKUM_22_01: It seems that when humans make other\nhumans happy, the happy humans\nproduce a substance known as a\n<color yellow<Gratitude Crystal>coloroff>.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) AKUM_22_02: <color yellow<Gratitude Crystals>coloroff> are quite amazing!\nJust looking at them and knowing there\nwas such gratitude in the world could\nturn me from a monster into a human!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) AKUM_23: <0x10009:0x00000007>Oh goodness, nothing would delight me\nmore than to become a human!\n\n\nFrom the moment I laid my regrettably\ndemonic eyes on you, I could tell\nyou had a gentle and generous heart.
