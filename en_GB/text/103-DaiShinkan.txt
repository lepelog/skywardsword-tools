(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_01_01: <0x10009:0x00000005>Don't worry, <heroname>--I'll be\nsure to explain your predicament to\n<color blue<Instructor Horwell>coloroff>.<pause 15> Go find him and\nask him to meet me in my quarters.\nWhile we chat, why don't you go ask\nsome of the other students about your\nbird? I seem to recall a few of them\nwere gathered near the plaza.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_01_01_1: <0x10009:0x00000001>Ah, hello, <heroname>. Have you\nmanaged to find your Loftwing yet?\n\n\n<pause 40>You suspect that <color blue<Groose>coloroff> had a hand in\nyour bird's disappearance? I tell you,\nthat boy is always up to trouble.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_01_01_2: ...Headmaster, if that is true, then all\nthe better. Groose has made it that\nmuch easier to delay the start of\nthe race.\nI doubt even Groose will have the gall\nto complain openly, considering it's his\nfault we had to delay in the first place.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_01_01_3: I see. Yes, he has painted himself into\na bit of a corner, hasn't he? Well, it's\nsettled then.\n\n<0x30001:0x><heroname>, don't worry about\nthe race starting without you. Take the\ntime you need to find your Loftwing.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_01_01_4: <0x10009:0x00000005>Still can't find your bird?\n\n\n\nCalm yourself and use your head.\nI'm sure you'll find a lead to his\nwhereabouts soon.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_03_01: <0x10009:0x00000005>Quite a number of inexplicable things\nseem to be happening here...\n\n\nWhat might happen if you do as that\nstrange being asks?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_03_11: <0x10009:0x00000001>I hear your sparring instructor,\nthe <color red<Knight Commander>coloroff>, also knows\nthat you will set out from Skyloft. \nHe's concerned for you.\nWhy don't you consider stopping by\nthe Sparring Hall and speaking with\nhim before you go?\n\n<0x30001:0x><heroname>...be safe out there.\nI'm counting on you to find Zelda!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_03_12: <0x10009:0x00000002>Ah, <heroname>! How goes your\nsearch? Have you found any leads as\nto Zelda's whereabouts?\n\nI feel terrible forcing you to face this\ntask alone, but we mustn't let the\nrest of the village catch wind of what\ntranspired that awful night.\nIf the truth of what we saw that night\nwas exposed to the village, it could\ncause mass confusion amongst the\npeople here.\nI'm afraid this mission has to fall to\nyou alone. Good luck, and may the\nwinds be at your back. 
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_03_13_0: You're back, <heroname>!\nGood to see you're still in one piece.\n\n\nSo, how's it going down there? Are you\nany closer to finding my Zelda? 
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_03_13_1: <0x10009:0x00000005>Hmm... I see<0x10006:0xfbcd>...<0x10006:0x00cd> My dear Zelda... \nThings must be terribly trying for her\ndown there.\n\nAnd it can't be easy for you now either,\ncan it?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_03_13: What?<pause 40> You want to know the lyrics to\nthe song Zelda sang on the day of the\nWing Ceremony?\n\nYou know, I'm not much of a singer...\n[1-]Just lyrics![2-]Sing it!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_03_14: Listen--as I said, I wouldn't feel \ncomfortable serenading you. But if it's\nthe lyrics you're after, I can recite\nthem for you. Let's see...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_03_15: You just want the lyrics? Oh! What a\nrelief. You really put me on the spot\nthere for a moment. I believe the lyrics\ngo something like this...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_03_16: <color yellow white<<0x10006:0xfccd>Oh youth, guided by the servant of the\ngoddess, unite earth and sky, and\nbring light to the land.>coloroff><0x10006:0x00cd>\n\nThat's the first part, but as I recall\nthere's a second verse to the song.\n\n\n<color yellow white<<0x10006:0xfccd>Oh youth, show the two whirling sails\nthe way to the Light Tower...and\nbefore you a path shall open, and a\nheavenly song you shall hear.<0x10006:0x00cd>>coloroff>
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_03_17: I believe that's the whole thing.\n\n\n\nThe <color red<Light Tower>coloroff> mentioned in the song\nis a real place; I'm sure you've seen the\ntower in the plaza. I don't know a thing\nabout two whirling sails though<0x10006:0xfecd>...\nIt sounds like the song is suggesting\nthat if one shows these whirling sails\nthe way to the tower, something will\nhappen?\nBut how do you go about doing that,\nand what does it mean? <color red<Two whirling\nsails>coloroff>. Hmm<0x10006:0xfecd>...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_03_18: Guide the two great whirling sails\ntoward the Light Tower. The youth who\ndoes so shall be led to the place where\nsongs of legend dwell. \n<0x30001:0x><heroname>, these lyrics have\nbeen passed down through countless\ngenerations here in Skyloft.\n\nThere's a strong probability that the\n<color red<two whirling sails >coloroff>the song mentions\nmust also exist somewhere in Skyloft.\n\nBear in mind, this is only a wild theory,\nbut hopefully some of this will prove\nuseful in your search.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_06: <0x30001:0x><heroname>, you're the only hope\nZelda has now. I'm counting on you.\n\n\nFind her and bring her home safe as\nquickly as you can!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_06_01: Ah, hello, <heroname>! Have you\nheard anything more about my\ndaughter?\n\nWhat is it<0x10006:0xfecd>...<0x10006:0x00cd>? If you know anything at\nall, I urge you to share it with me.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_06_02: <0x10006:0xfecd>...<0x10006:0x00cd>You want to tell me but you can't?\nHmm. I...understand. I'm sure you\nhave good reason for keeping quiet<0x10006:0xfecd>...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_06_04: <0x30001:0x><heroname>, I've been doing\nsome thinking since we last spoke.\n\n\nYou have had this destiny thrust upon\nyou without warning...or choice, for\nthat matter. But I wish to help you as\nbest I can.\nI'm getting older, and I lack the\nvigor of youth<0x10006:0xfecd>...<0x10006:0x00cd>but even old men\nhave ways of being useful, too!\n\nI wish to share as much of my\nknowledge with you as I can!\n\n\nIf you have any question...any question\nat all about Skyloft or its history, I will\nbe glad to tell you all that I know.\n[1-]Actually...[2-]Not now.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_06_03: What do I know of the <color yellow white<Triforce>coloroff><0x10006:0xfecd>...<0x10006:0x00cd>?\n\n\n\n<0x30001:0x><heroname>, where did you hear\nthat word?\n\n\nIt's true that the ancient texts make\nseveral mentions of the Triforce\nwithin their pages.\n\nUnfortunately, the actual location of\nthe Triforce isn't illuminated in\nany of those tomes. Its whereabouts\nare lost to history.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_06_05: So you have no need for the wisdom of\nan old man like myself?\n\n\nWell, just remember that the wisdom\nof years can prevail where youth alone\nmight fall short. If you desire my help,\nI'll be here.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_06_06: Sorry, <heroname>. It shames me\nto say it, but my knowledge is of little\nuse on this subject.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_06_07: <0x10009:0x00000002>Do I know anyone else who might know\nmore about the Triforce?\n\n\nWithin Skyloft? No, I doubt anyone\nelse in town would know much about a\nsubject as ancient and archaic as that...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_06_08: I see. So Levias is possessed...\nThe Spiral Charge is a high-risk\nmaneuver, so make sure you know\nwhat you're doing when you unleash it!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_06_09: <0x10009:0x00000002>It's happened, <heroname>!\n\n\n\nThe goddess...<pause 30> The goddess and her\nisle have vanished from Skyloft!\n[1-]The truth is...[2-]Err...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_06_10: No need to explain, <heroname>!\n\n\n\n<color yellow white<When all catastrophes are overcome,\nonly then will the goddess make her\nreturn to the surface.>coloroff>\n\nThese are the last of the <color red<secret words>coloroff>\npassed down here in Skyloft.<pause 20> It is only\nnow that I realize the significance of\nthem. Yes...\nTheir meaning is clear to me. This must\nmean it's all over...<pause 20> And my Zelda...<pause 10>\nshe's safe at last?\n[1-]I'm sorry.[2-]No.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_06_16: And...whatever other surprises fate\nmay have in store for you, I'm sure you\nwill triumph. We're counting on you\nafter all!\nJust stay focused on the task at hand. \nPut all your strength into it, and you\ncan't go wrong!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_06_12: <0x10009:0x00000004>I have faith that you shall bring my\ndaughter back to me. I desire that\nmore than an explanation of whatever\nit was that transpired here!\nGood luck, <heroname>!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_06_11: Amazing! So you've not only calmed\nthe senseless rage that gripped\nLevias, but you've also discerned the\nlocation of the Triforce as well?\n<0x30001:0x><heroname>, lately you've grown\nso much that I feel as though I am\nlooking at a different person each\ntime we meet.\nMany troubles still await you, no doubt,\nbut I'm confident you shall overcome\nany obstacle that stands in your way.\nMay the goddess protect you!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_06_13: <0x10009:0x00000002>Hello, <heroname>! I hope your\nsearch is progressing well.\n\n\nYou need to find somewhere to insert\nthis <color red<<item 180>>coloroff>, you say?\n\n\nThat gem...yes, I do believe I have seen\nsomething that it might fit into, but I\njust can't recall where...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_06_14: <0x10009:0x00000004>I'm quite certain I've seen a stone like\nthat before, but I don't recall where.\n\n\nPerhaps the town fortune-teller might\nbe able to put you on the right track?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_06_15: <0x10009:0x00000004>I could've sworn I heard the most\nthunderous noise outside a moment\nago.\n\nWell, it's probably just these old ears\nplaying tricks on me. Don't let me hold\nyou up. I'm counting on you to bring\nZelda back!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_07_01: <0x30001:0x><heroname>, just a moment!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_07_02: Though, there is one whose vast\nknowledge may be of use...\n\n\nSurely you're familiar with <color blue<Levias>coloroff>, the\ngreat<color red< sky spirit >coloroff>who has guarded our\nrealm for ages?\n\n<0x1000A:0x000200cd>Levias has served as the protector\nof our skies for a long time, and his\nknowledge of our world is\nencyclopedic, to put it mildly.\nIf anyone in the entirety of Skyloft and\nbeyond were to know about the\nTriforce, it would be him.\n[1-]Where is he?[2-]Encyclopedic?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_07_03a: Yes... I feared that might be your next\nquestion. About that...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_07_03b: Yes, his knowledge is almost limitless,\nbut I fear meeting him may be harder\nthan you anticipate...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_07_03: I imagine in your travels you've taken\nnotice of the tremendous <color red<thunderhead>coloroff>\nthat suddenly appeared in our skies.\n\nRecently, I've heard rumors suggesting\nthat Levias is trapped inside that\nmassive cloud.\n
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_07_04: I asked <color blue<Instructor Owlan>coloroff> to look into\nthis troubling cloud in order to\ndetermine if there is any truth to these\nrumors.\nI had meant to inquire about his\nfindings earlier but completely forgot\nabout it after Zelda went missing.\n\n<color blue<Instructor Owlan>coloroff> can fill me in on the\ndetails later, so why don't you go\nspeak with him yourself and see\nwhat his investigation has revealed?
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_07_05: If you wish to know more about\nLevias's current location, speak with\n<color blue<Instructor Owlan>coloroff>. He should be in his\nchambers next door.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) Dai_07_06: <0x10009:0x00000017>What are you standing around for?\nEveryone's already in the sky! Jump\noff the edge and call your bird!
