(unk1: 01, unk2: 0) MT_FIRE_DORAGON_00: I'm afraid that eruption was caused by\nan explosion of my power. It looks like\nyou were caught up in it. My apologies.\n\nThe skies above this land should clear\nsoon...\n\n\nYou should go.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) MT_FIRE_DORAGON_01: <0x10009:0x00000701>Yes... You appear as if summoned!\n\n\n\n<0x10009:0x00000700>Young hero, do you wish to ask a\nquestion of me?\n[1-]<color blue<Water Dragon>coloroff>?[2-]<color blue<Thunder Dragon>coloroff>?[3-]Volcano?[4]No, thanks.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) MT_FIRE_DORAGON_02: <0x10009:0x00070702>Yes... The <color blue<Water Dragon>coloroff>. You see,\nthe goddess gave the Water Dragon\nthe power to protect the woods.\n\n<0x10009:0x00000700>That power is strong, but the will of the\ndragon is even stronger. ...You may\nwant to be careful with that one, lest\nyou be eaten like an appetizer.\n<0x10009:0x00000703>Ha ha ha ha!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) MT_FIRE_DORAGON_03: <0x10009:0x00070702>Yes, yes... The <color blue<Thunder Dragon>coloroff>.\nThe goddess gave the Thunder Dragon\nthe power to protect the desert.\n\nThis dragon possesses a <color red<legendary\nshield>coloroff>. It is truly one of its most prized\ntreasures.\n\n<0x10009:0x00000700>It is said that the Thunder Dragon\ndelights in testing those with promise\nin the hopes of someday finding a\nworthy recipient for the shield.\nBut the dragon is a wily one. And his\ntest is not as simple as it may appear!\n\n\n<0x10009:0x00000003>Ha ha ha ha!
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) MT_FIRE_DORAGON_04: <0x10009:0x00070702>Yes... This mountain was not always\nsuch a dangerous and unforgiving\nplace.\n\n<0x10009:0x00000700>There was a time when those above-\nground and those below lived together\nin harmony by the blessing of the\ngreat mountain.\n<0x10009:0x00000700>The desolation that you see now is all\nthat remains to remind us of those\nglorious days...
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) MT_FIRE_DORAGON_05: <0x10009:0x00000702>Yes... You see the path before you,\nthen. Go. Follow it.
(unk1: 01, unk2: 1) MT_FIRE_DORAGON_06: <0x10009:0x00000700>What is this? You have another\nquestion for me?\n[1-]<color blue<Water Dragon>coloroff>?[2-]<color blue<Thunder Dragon>coloroff>?[3-]Volcano?[4]Not really.
